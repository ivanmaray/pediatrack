6, 7, 21, 22, 
26, 51, 53, 
59, 65, 76, 
101 
Appendix 
D.1. 
The criteria chosen by the 
SIOP-E PNET biology 
group  are  no  longer  only 
based on 
immunohistochemistry, 
showing   stabilisation   of 
nuclear   β   catenin 
expression. Current 
criteria   also   incorporate 
molecular diagnosis 
either  with  direct  β 
catenin mutation 
assessment,   or   indirect 
WNT  subgrouping  based 
on  the  documentation  of 
somatic  monosomy  6,  as 
recommended in a recent 
international consensus 
11 – 2014, 
Nov 17 
Assessments for obtaining WNT-status 
updated: 
 ß-catenin by IHC, mandatory 
(unchanged) 
 ß-catenin mutation, mandatory (was 
optional) 
 monosomy 6 status, optional (added)

Diagram for Definition of WNT subgroup status 
added 
 
6 
2 Definition of upper age limit for LR-arm 7, 21, 51, 
55, 65 
Recent clinical trials 
suggest that WNT 
subgroup patients have  a 
bimodal  age  distribution 
and  that  patients  greater 
than 16 years at diagnosis 
do   not share   the   good 
prognosis of younger 
WNT-subgroup patients 
11 – 2014, 
Nov 17 
Rationale for upper age-limit in LR-arm added 38 
3 Reduction of CSI dose in LR-arm: 
From 23.4 Gy to 18.0 Gy for brain and spine in 
10 daily fraction instead of 13 
Primary tumour  boost  changed  from  30.6  to 
36.0 Gy in 20 daily fractions instead of 17 
7, 21, 23, 
51, 80, 105 
Appendix 
C.1 
The good prognosis of the 
WNT-subgroup    allow    a 
further   de-escalation   of 
craniospinal    dose    from 
23.4  to  18.0  Gy,  which  is 
expected     to     allow     a 
better  cognitive  function 
in    the    years    following 
treatment.  
A craniospinal dose 
reduction     is     currently 
performed in the ongoing 
St.-Jude   study   (SJMB12, 
opened  in  2013)  and  is 
planned  in  the  next  COG 
protocol. 
11 – 2014, 
Nov 17 
Rationale for lowering the craniospinal dose in 
the LR arm of the PNET 5 MB study added 
41-42 
Sentence  removed: Radiotherapy  doeses  and 
technique  are  the  same  in  PNET  5  MB-LR  and 
both treatment arms of PNET 5 MB-SR.

 Substantial Changes Page Rationale  
4 Criteria  for  a particular  per-protocol  analysis 
for patients who started radiotherapy later than 
40 days after surgery added. 
105 Patients cannot be 
excluded   from   study   if 
radiotherapy   is   delayed 
after inclusion, but 
patients     will not be 
included   in   per-protocol 
analysis 
11 – 2014, 
Nov 17 
5 Possibility  and  terms  of participation  for  new 
countries added 
18 High interest from further 
countries to participate 
11 – 2014, 
Nov 17 
6 Updated  chapter  for data  aquisition  for  QoS 
assessments to    enable    the    use    of    the 
“HealthTracker” 
71 HealthTracker  chosen  by 
QoS     study     group     as 
database for QoS data 
11 – 2014, 
Nov 17 
Requirements  on data  management  for  QoS 
assessments added 
76 
7 Added inclusion criteria: 
 New definition of WNT-positivity/ 
WNT-negativity 
21ff 
21, 22, 26, 
56 
 
See 1. 
 
11 – 2014, 
Nov 17 
 Upper age limit in LR-arm 16 years 
7, 21, 55 See 2.  
 Timeline of 14 days for 2
nd
 surgery 
removed and changed into “if timeline 
for start of radiotherapy can be kept” 
 Submission of blood and CSF obligatory 
for all patients, who agree on germline 
DNA studies. Submission of CSF is 
recommended.Foreseeable inability to 
start radiotherapy within 40 days after 
surgery renders patients ineligible 
 Screening for the compliance with 
eligibility criteria should be completed, 
and patient should be included into 
the study within 28 days after first 
surgery (in case of second surgery 
within 35 days after first surgery). 
Inclusion of patients is not possible 
later than 40 days after first tumour 
surgery, or after start of radiotherapy. 
 Information must be provided to the 
patient on biological studies (tumour 
and germline), and written informed 
consent obtained of agreement for 
participation). 
22, 26, 56, 
57 
More precise definition of 
requirements 
 
8 Added exclusion criteria: 
 Ependymoblastoma 
 
 
 WNT subgroup status not 
determinable (replaces ß-catenin 
status) 
22, 26, 57 
 
 
Was not mentioned 
before, but necessary to 
be excluded 
WNT  subgroup  needs  to 
be defined     to     allow 
inclusion

The  study PNET  5  MB  has been  designed  for  children  with  medulloblastoma  of  standard  risk 
(according to the risk-group definitions which have been used so far; e.g. in PNET 4). With the advent 
of  biological  parameters  for  stratification  into  clinical  medulloblastoma  trials,  the WNT  subgroup 
status and the age of the patient will be the criteria according to which study patients will be assigned 
to either treatment arm PNET 5 MB - LR or to PNET 5 MB - SR, respectively. The initial diagnostic 
assessments (imaging, staging, histology, and tumour biology) required for study entry are the same 
for both treatment arms. To facilitate their use by the participating institutions, both treatment arms 
are described here in separate synopses.

TITLE 
An International Prospective Study in Children Older than 3 to 5 Years with 
Clinically Standard-Risk Medulloblastoma with Low-Risk Biological Profile 
SPONSOR 
University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany 
STUDY COORDINATOR 
Stefan Rutkowski, Hamburg and Co-PI: François Doz, Paris 
STUDY DESIGN 
This is an international, prospective, Phase-II, open study in patients between 
the ages of 3 to 5 years and less than 16.0 years, with ‘standard-risk’ 
medulloblastoma and a low-risk biological profile. 
OBJECTIVES 
Primary objective: 
- to confirm that the 3-year Event-Free Survival (EFS) rate in children and 
adolescents with standard-risk medulloblastoma having a low-risk biological 
profile remains in excess of 80% when patients are treated with 18.0 Gy 
neuraxis irradiation plus boost to the primary tumour, and reduced-intensity 
chemotherapy. 
Secondary objectives: 
- to investigate the Overall Survival (OS) rate, and the pattern of relapse in this 
patient group, 
- to  study  the  late  effects  of  the  reduced-dose  approach,  focusing  on  hearing, 
endocrine,  and  neurologic  function,  and  standardized,  patients/  parents  rated 
measurments   of   health   status,   executive   function,   behavioural   outcome, 
medical, educational, employment and social situation, and quality of life.  
- to conduct comprehensive studies in a prospective fashion on the biological 
basis of WNT-subgroup medulloblastoma, with the aim of identification, 
investigation and validation of biomarkers and drug targets with therapeutic 
potential in this disease subgroup. These investigations will focus on (i). 
detailed analysis of biological pathways and molecular events established to 
play a role in medulloblastoma, or that are of potential prognostic significance 
in this disease group, (ii). comprehensive genome-wide investigations of novel 
medulloblastoma defects, and (iii). defining diagnostic correlates of WNT 
pathway activation.. 
NUMBER OF PATIENTS 
The expected annual accrual rate is 10 to 12 patients. With a duration of 
inclusion of 6 years, 60 patients may be included in the study. 
STUDY POPULATION 
Inclusion criteria: 
a) Age at diagnosis, at least 3 - 5 years (depending on the country) and less than 
16.0 years. The date of diagnosis is the date on which surgery is undertaken; 
b) Histologically proven medulloblastoma, including the following subtypes, as 
defined in the WHO classification (2007): 
- classic medulloblastoma, 
- desmoplastic/nodular medulloblastoma 
Pre-treatment central pathology review is considered mandatory. 
c) Standard-risk medulloblastoma, defined as; 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
22 
- total or near total surgical resection with less than or equal to 1.5 cm
2
 
(measured on axial plane) of residual tumour on early post-operative 
MRI, without and with contrast, on central review; 
 - no CNS metastasis on MRI (cranial and spinal) on central review; 
 - no tumour cells on the cytospin of lumbar CSF  
 - no clinical evidence of extra-CNS metastasis; 
Patients with a reduction of postoperative residual tumour through second 
surgery to less than or equal to 1.5 cm
2
 are eligible, if timeline for start of 
radiotherapy can be kept. 
d) Submission of high quality biological material including fresh frozen tumour 
samples for the molecular assessment of biological markers (such as the 
assessment of MYC gene copy number status) in national biological 
reference centers. Submission of blood is mandatory for all patients, who 
agree on germline DNA studies. Submission of CSF is recommended. 
e)  No amplification of MYC or MYCN (determined by FISH); 
f) Low-risk biological profile, defined as WNT subgroup positivity. The 
WNT subgroup is defined by the presence of (i) ß-catenin mutation 
(mandatory testing), or (ii) ß-catenin nuclear immuno-positivity by IHC 
(mandatory testing) and ß-catenin mutation, or (iii) ß-catenin nuclear 
immuno-positivity by IHC and monosomy 6 (optionaltesting). 
g) No prior therapy for medulloblastoma other than surgery; 
h) Radiotherapy aiming to start no more than 28 days after surgery. Foreseeable 
inability to start radiotherapy within 40 days after surgery renders patients 
ineligible for the study 
i) Screening for the compliance with eligibility criteria should be completed, 
and patient should be included into the study within 28 days after first 
surgery (in case of second surgery within 35 days after first surgery). 
Inclusion of patients is not possible later than 40 days after first tumour 
surgery, or after start of radiotherapy. 
j) CTC grades < 2 for liver, renal, haematological function  
k) No significant sensineural hearing deficit as defined by pure tone 
audiomentry with bone conduction or air conduction and normal 
tympanogram showing no impairement ≥ 20 dB at 1-3 kHz. If performance 
of pure tone audiometry is not possible postoperatively, normal otoacoustic 
emissions are acceptable, if there is no history for hearing deficit. 
l)  No medical contraindication to radiotherapy or chemotherapy, such as 
preexisting DNA breakage syndromes (e.g. Fanconi Anemia, Nijmegen 
breakage syndrome), Gorlin Syndrome or other reasons as defined by 
patient’s clinician;  
m) No identified Turcot and Li Fraumeni syndrome.  
n) Written informed consent (and patient assent where appropriate) for therapy 
according  to  the  laws  of  each  participating  country. Information  must  be 
provided  to  the  patient  on  biological  studies  (tumour  and  germline),  and 
written informed consent obtained of agreement for participation. 
o) National and local ethical committee approval according to the laws of each 
participating country (to include approval for biological studies). 
 
Exclusion criteria: 
a) One of the inclusion criteria is lacking; 
b) Brainstem or supratentorial primitive neuro-ectodermal tumour; 
c) Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumour; 
d) Medulloepithelioma; Ependymoblastoma 
e) Large-cell medulloblastoma, anaplastic medulloblastoma, or 
medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity (MBEN), confirmed on central 
pathological review. 
f) Unfavourable or undeterminable biological profile, defined as 
amplification of MYC or MYCN, or WNT subgroup status not determinable. 
g) Metastatic medulloblastoma (on CNS MRI and/or positive cytospin of 
postoperative lumbar CSF); 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
23 
h) Patient previously treated for a brain tumour or any type of malignant 
disease; 
i) DNA breakage syndromes (e.g. Fanconi anemia, Nijmegen breakage

STATISTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS 
The primary endpoint is the 3-year EFS rate. The aim of the study is to achieve 
a 3-year rate in excess of 80%. 
Results will be analysed according to a modified multistage Fleming procedure, 
in order to be able to stop the trial early only if too many events are observed. 
Sixty patients are to be included in the trial. Three interim analyses, the third one 
being the final one, will take place when 20, then 40 and finally 60 patients have 
been included and these patients will be followed for at least 36 months. Results 
of the interim analyses will be reviewed by an independent Data Monitoring and 
Safety Committee (DMSC). 
Calculations of the boundaries have been performed assuming a 36 months EFS 
rate less than or equal to 80% as not acceptable (null hypothesis) and 
controlling the power in order to detect in 88% of cases a 36 months EFS rate 
equal or higher than 91%. The error risk  to wrongly accept the protocol is 
limited to 11%.  
EFS will be estimated from date of first operation. Any progression, any 
relapse, any occurrence of second malignancy, and any death will be 
considered as an event. 
The observed 36 months-rates will be calculated as crude rates, when all the 
studied patients will have at least 36 months of follow-up. When the results are

analysed, if all patients do not have the required 36 months minimum follow-
up, then the EFS rate will be estimated by Kaplan-Meier and compared to the 
corresponding Fleming lower boundary.

TITLE 
An International Prospective Study in Children Older than 3 to 5 Years with 
Clinically Standard-Risk Medulloblastoma with Average-Risk Biological 
Profile  
SPONSOR 
University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany 
STUDY COORDINATOR 
Stefan Rutkowski, Hamburg 
STUDY DESIGN 
This is an international, prospective, Phase-III, randomised study in patients 
between the ages of 3 to 5 years and less than 22 years, with ‘standard-risk’ 
medulloblastoma and an average-risk biological profile. 
OBJECTIVES 
Primary objective: 
- to test whether the Event-Free Survival (EFS) in children and adolescents with 
standard-risk medulloblastoma having an average-risk biological profile is 
different for patients treated with or without carboplatin concomitantly with 
radiotherapy (23.4 Gy neuraxis irradiation plus boost to the primary tumour) 
followed by a modified maintenance chemotherapy.  
Secondary objectives: 
-to investigate the Overall Survival rates (OS), the Progession-free survival 
rates (PFS), and the pattern of relapse in the randomized treatment arms. 
- to test the feasibility of carboplatin treatment concomitantly with radiotherapy 
- to study the late effects in the randomized treatment arms, focusing on 
hearing, endocrine, and neurologic function, and standardized, patients/ 
parents rated measurments of health status, executive function, behavioural 
outcome, medical, educational, employment and social situation, and quality 
of life.  
- to conduct comprehensive studies in a prospective fashion on the biological 
basis of standard-risk medulloblastoma, with the aim of identification, 
investigation and validation of biomarkers (diagnostic, prognostic and 
predictive) and drug targets with therapeutic potential in this disease subgroup. 
These investigations will focus on (i). detailed analysis of biological pathways 
and molecular events established to play a role in medulloblastoma, or that 
have been shown to have potential prognostic significance in this disease 
subgroup (e.g. chromosome 17 abnormalities), and (ii). comprehensive 
genome-wide investigations of novel medulloblastoma defects. 
 
NUMBER OF PATIENTS 
The expected accrual rate is 50 patients per year. With a duration of inclusion 
of 6 years, 300 patients may be included in the study.

e) No amplification of MYC or MYCN (determined by FISH); 
f) Average-risk biological profile, defined as WNT subgroup negativity. 
WNT-negative tumours are defined by (i) ß-catenin nuclear immuno-
negativity by IHC (mandatory testing), and the absence of ß-catenin 
mutation (mandatory testing) and monosomy 6 (optional testing),  or (ii) 
ß-catenin nuclear immuno-positivity by IHC (mandatory testing) in the 
absence of ß-catenin mutation and monosomy 6, or (iii) monosomy 6 in 
the absence of ß-catenin nuclear immuno-positivity by IHC or ß-catenin 
mutation.

diagnosis. The WNT subgroup is defined by the presence of (i) ß-catenin 
mutation (mandatory testing), or (ii) ß-catenin nuclear immuno-
positivity by IHC (mandatory testing) and ß-catenin mutation, or (iii) ß-
catenin nuclear immuno-positivity by IHC and monosomy 6 (optional 
testing). 
g) No prior therapy for medulloblastoma other than surgery; 
h) Radiotherapy aiming to start no more than 28 days after surgery. Foreseeable 
inability to start radiotherapy within 40 days after surgery renders patients 
ineligible for the study.

STATISTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS 
The  primary  endpoint  is  event-free  survival  (EFS).  The  aim  of  the  trial  is  the 
comparison  of  EFS  between  patients receiving  radiotherapy  and  8  cycles  of 
maintenance  chemotherapy  with  and  without  concurrent  carboplatin  during 
radiotherapy.   Does   the   concurrent   administration   of   carboplatin   during 
radiotherapy change the distribution of event-free survival times (EFS
OP
)? Null 
hypothesis:  The  distribution  of  EFS
OP
 between  patients  with  and  without 
concurrent  administration  of  chemotherapy  of  carboplatin  during  radiotherapy 
does not differ.  
This hypothesis will be tested with a two-sided log-rank test on difference. For 
descriptive reasons the Kaplan-Meier curves for the EFS
OP
, the quartiles of the 
EFS
OP
 with  95%-confidence  intervals,  and  the  EFS
OP
-rates  at  years  1,  3 and  5 
will be given for both arms.

Three analyses are to be performed to answer the main question, unless the trial 
is stopped prematurely. The trial will be terminated after an interim analysis, if 
the  main question can  already be  answered  at this interim analysis.  After each 
interim  analysis  a  data-dependent  sample  size  calculation will be  performed. 
Then, the accrual period, the observation time, the schedule of the second interim 
and final analysis (required number of events) and the number of interim analyses 
will be  adapted taking  the  data  into  account.  If  the  3-step  sequential  plan 
according to Wang and Tsiatis described above does not need to be changed, the 
first interim analysis will take place after 21 events, the second interim analysis 
will  take  place  after  42  events  and  the  final  analysis  will  take  place  after  105 
events.  
Sample  size  calculation  is  based  on  assumption  of  3-year  EFS
OP
 of  75%  for 
patients  with  standard  therapy.  3-year  EFS
OP
 for  patients  with  additional 
carboplatin during radiotherapy is assumed to be 10% higher, i.e. 85%. With a 
significance level of 5%, an accrual rate of 6 years and a follow-up period of 4 
years 299 patients will be needed to observe 105 events in both therapy arms and 
to  obtain  a  power  of  80%  with  a  3-step  group  sequential  design  according  to 
Wang and Tsiatis with boundary shape parameter of ∆ = 0.37 when using the 
log-rank test. This corresponds to an accrual rate of 50 patients per year.

4. Background and Rationale 
  
Medulloblastoma is a highly cellular malignant embryonal neoplasm classified as a Primitive Neuro-
ectodermal  Tumour [PNET] .(Louis,  Ohgaki  et  al.  2007) It  is  the  most  common  malignant  brain 
tumour  in  children,  accounting  for  between  15  and  20  %  of  all  childhood  primary  central  nervous 
system (CNS) neoplasms. Medulloblastoma arises in the posterior fossa, usually from the cerebellar 
vermis  in  the  roof  of  the  4
th
 ventricle.  As  with  other  PNETs,  medulloblastomas  have  a  marked 
propensity to metastasize via CSF pathways, and evidence of such metastatic spread is present in up 
to 35 % of cases at diagnosis. 
 
The following histological variants of medulloblastoma are recognised in the WHO classification of 
CNS tumours (2007): 
- Classic medulloblastoma, 
- Desmoplastic/nodular medulloblastoma 
- Medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity  
- Large-cell medulloblastoma 
- Anaplastic medulloblastoma 
 
The treatment of medulloblastoma currently involves surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and 
chemotherapy. While this combined-modality treatment regimen has substantially improved the cure 
rate,  medulloblastoma  remains  incurable  in  approximately  one-third  of  patients,(Gilbertson  2004), 
and 20-25% of standard risk patients.(Gajjar, Chintagumpala et al. 2006; Packer, Gajjar et al. 2006) 
Moreover, survivors suffer from long-term toxic side effects related to therapy that often seriously 
affect  their  quality  of  life.(Ris,  Packer  et  al.  2001;  Gurney,  Kadan-Lottick  et  al.  2003;  Maddrey, 
Bergeron et al. 2005; Mulhern, Palmer et al. 2005)
 
 
 
In the previous trials, prognosis was most commonly assessed based on clinical criteria. Risk-adapted 
treatment  of  medulloblastoma  was  established,  using  age,  extent  of  resection,  and  presence  of 
metastases for stratification. However, this stratification is not optimal for a numerically significant 
subset of patients. Some of them suffer from early relapse although they are stratified as clinically 
low risk patients, other receive intense and toxic therapy although they might have a good prognosis 
with less intense therapy.  
Recent  data  suggest  that  the  histological  subtype  of  medulloblastoma  as  well  as  biological  factors 
influence    the    clinical    behaviour,    and    can    therefore    be    used    to    optimize    treatment 
stratification.(Eberhart, Kepner et al. 2002; Pomeroy, Tamayo et al. 2002; Rutkowski, von Hoff et al. 
2010)
 
 
 
 
4.1. Clinical Risk Stratification and the Concept of Standard-risk Medulloblastoma 
The  prognosis  of  medulloblastoma  is  closely  related  to  three  main  clinical  factors;  the  age  of  the 
patient, the extent of disease at diagnosis (presence of metastases) and the extent of residual disease 
after tumour resection. These factors are again influenced by the biology of the tumour, which also 
influences the histological appearance.  
 
4.1.1. Age of the Patient 
Age less than 3 years is associated with a 2-fold higher risk of disease progression within 5 years of 
diagnosis in comparison  with older patients.(Zeltzer,  Boyett et  al. 1999; Packer, Rood et al. 2003) 
One of the reasons for this less favourable prognosis is a different biological behaviour. It is known 
that different histological and biological medulloblastoma subtypes have different age distributions. 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
30 
In  infants,  nodular  desmoplastic  medulloblastomas  are  frequent,  and  are  associated  with  a  good 
prognosis. On the reverse side, prognosis of infants with classic medulloblastoma is worse compared 
to older children with classic medulloblastoma.(Grill, Sainte-Rose et al. 2005; Rutkowski, Bode et 
al.  2005) Decreased prognosis is  also  explained  by an  unwillingness to  apply  dose-intense 
radiotherapy in this young age group, as this causes severe damage to the developing brain. (Duffner, 
Horowitz et al. 1993) Due to these factors, infants are not considered to be “standard risk” patients, 
and cannot be included into this trial. 
 
4.1.2. Metastatic Disease 
Patients with disseminated disease have a much poorer prognosis. The presence of metastatic disease 
at presentation as diagnosed by the presence of meningeal enhancement on MRI of the brain (Chang 
Stage M2) or spine (Chang Stage M3) clearly carries a poor prognosis.(Chang, Housepian et al. 1969; 
Zeltzer, Boyett et al. 1999) Although it was not consistently used for stratification in the early trials, 
microscopic  spread  to  the  CSF  has  also  been  shown  to  be  associated  with  an  impaired  prognosis, 
independently of the presence of macroscopic metastases.(Fouladi, Gajjar et al. 1999; Miralbell, Bieri 
et  al.  1999;  Verlooy,  Mosseri  et  al.  2006;  von  Hoff,  Hinkes  et  al.  2009)
 
It is widely  accepted  that 
patients must be staged by MRI and CSF analysis to exclude metastases in order to be regarded as 
standard risk patients. However, in a multicenter trial with a large number of participating centers, 
technique  and  quality  of  MRI  imaging  differs.  Therefore, a  standardised imaging  technique  was 
defined in PNET 4 and central reference assessment of the MRI was recommended. Within this trial 
the outcome of patients whose scans had not been centrally reviewed was found to be worse than of 
patients in which central review of MRI scans of brain and spine had taken place.. This suggests that 
quality  assurance  of  imaging  is  a relevant  tool  for  keeping  the  group  of  included  patients  clear  of 
patients with falsely negative metastasis staging. The relevance of MRI review has also been shown 
by other groups.(Oyharcabal-Bourden, Kalifa et al. 2005; Packer, Gajjar et al. 2006) 
 
4.1.3. Residual Disease 
Few  studies  have  demonstrated  the  prognostic  importance  of  achieving  a  gross total  or  near  gross 
total  surgical  excision(Albright,  Wisoff  et  al.  1996;  Zeltzer,  Boyett  et  al.  1999), although  the 
difference  was  only  seen  in  the  subgroup  of  M0  patients.  Consequently, most  of  the  international 
trails  excluded  patients  with  residual tumours  larger  than  1.5  cm
2
 from  “standard-risk”  trials, 
precluding  the  possibility  to  further  evaluate  this  factor.  However,  in  the  HIT-91  study,  and  the 
PNET-3  study  no  significant  impact  of  residual tumour has  been  shown  on  outcome,  leading  to 
decision to include incompletely resected patients within the PNET 4 trial.(Taylor, Bailey et al. 2003; 
von  Hoff,  Hinkes  et al.  2009) Within  PNET 4 residual tumour >  1.5  cm
2
 was  associated  with  an 
impaired  prognosis.  Therefore, patients  with  residual tumours  >  1.5  cm
2
 are  not  considered  as 
standard  risk  patients  within PNET  5  MB - LR and PNET  5  MB - SR. If  incompletely  resected 
tumours are amenable for second surgery, patients can be included in PNET 5 MB - LR and PNET 5 
MB - SR as  long  as  the  residual  tumour  post  second  surgery  is  <1.5cm
2
,  and if  second  surgery  is 
performed within 14 days after first surgery. 
 
It is important to note that the definition of 1.5 cm
2
 (on MRI) as the limit for inclusion is arbitrary. 
Other groups used the definition of “any measurable” tumour on MRI (Oyharcabal-Bourden, Kalifa 
et  al.  2005),  and  even  within  groups  that  use  the  definition  of 1.5  cm
2
 there  is  no  international 
consensus about the plane in which this area should be measured and calculated. As the early trials 
were based on CT imaging, the axial plain was commonly used for area calculation. But with the use 
of MRI, calculation of residual tumour area was also estimated in the maximum cross-sectional area, 
or 3-dimensionally as volume. To allow comparability to the earlier trials, it has been decided to use 
1,5 cm
2
 on axial plane in PNET 5 MB - LR and PNET 5 MB - SR.  
 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
31 
For  estimation  of  residual  disease  patient’s  pre-operative  MRI  imaging  is  compared  with  that 
obtained  post-operatively.  To  allow  proper  comparison,  adherence  to  the  standard  MRI  technique 
described  in the  protocol  is  important  (see  chapter 9.2.  Recommendations  for  imaging  and  central 
MRI review, page 62) 
 
It is accepted that postoperative imaging is best performed within 72 hours of surgery, after which 
post-operative changes render interpretation of residual disease difficult. Therefore for the purposes 
of this trial all patients should have post-operative MRI imaging before and after contrast injection 
within 72 hours of surgery.  
 
4.2. Stratification based on histological subtypes of medulloblastoma 
Histological  classification  of  medulloblastoma  has improved  over the  last  years.  The  following 
histological variants of medulloblastoma are recognised in the WHO classification of CNS tumours 
(2007):  classic  medulloblastoma,  desmoplastic/nodular  medulloblastoma,  medulloblastoma  with 
extensive nodularity, large-cell medulloblastoma, anaplastic medulloblastoma.(Louis, Ohgaki et al. 
2007) According to this classification, tumours with myogenic or melanocytic differentiation are no 
longer regarded as separate entities but as features that may occur in the different variants described 
above. Extensive immunohistochemical evaluation and reticulin staining is mandatory to define these 
entities in diagnostic workup and to exclude differential diagnoses such as astrocytic and ependymal 
neoplasms, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumours, plexus carcinomas and other entities. 
Several studies have shown that these variants have different clinical behaviours. Therefore, current 
treatment strategies use histology as a tool for patients’ stratification. 
 
4.2.1. Large cell medulloblastoma, anaplastic medulloblastoma 
These variants were formerly grouped together as anaplastic/large cell medulloblastomas. However, 
the current classification separates these entities.  
 
Large  cell  medulloblastoma  was  been  defined  as  a  separate  entitiy,  after  its  initial  description  in 
1992.(Giangaspero, Rigobello et al. 1992) It is characterized by monomorphic cells with large round 
vesicular nuclei, single prominent nucleoli and variable amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm. The cells 
often lack cohesiveness and mitotic as well as apoptotic figures are frequent. These cells have to be 
predominant in the specimen. Their focal occurrence does not qualify for the diagnosis of this variant. 
Large cell medulloblastomas frequently show a dot-like synatophaysin reactivity. 
The clinical impact of this rare variant, with a highly aggressive behaviour was described in several 
reports. (Brown, Kepner et al. 2000; McManamy, Lamont et al. 2003) 
 
Severe cytological anaplasia was recognised to be a negative prognostic factor. (Eberhart, Kepner et 
al.  2002) In  the  WHO  classification  of  2007  anaplastic  medulloblastoma  has  been  accepted  as  a 
histological subgroup.(Louis, Ohgaki et al. 2007) The cytological signs of severe anaplasia such as 
marked  nuclear  and  cellular  pleomorphism,  nuclear  moulding  (wrapping)  and  high  mitotic  and 
apoptotic  activity  have  to  be  predominant  to  qualify  for  this  diagnosis.  Focal  severe  anaplasia  or 
diffuse moderate anaplasia do not confer the diagnosis of an anaplastic variant of medulloblastoma. 
On the molecular level, it has been shown that both, large cell and anaplastic medulloblastoma are 
associated  with MYC amplification(Lamont,  McManamy  et  al.  2004) and  expression. (Eberhart, 
Kratz et al. 2004; Stearns, Chaudhry et al. 2006) But not all large cell and anaplastic medulloblastoma 
show MYC amplification,  and  the  prognostic  relevance  of  histology  in  the  absence  of MYC 
abnormalities is not clear. (von Hoff, Hartmann et al. 2009) 
However,  due  to their negative prognostic significance,  large  cell  and  anaplastic  medulloblastoma 
were  excluded  from  randomisation  in  the  PNET-4  trial.  Patients  with  large  cell  or  anaplastic

medulloblastoma cannot be considered as standard risk patients. Further research may further define 
this group and allow for the risk adapted treatment. 
Patients  with  large  cell  or  anaplastic  medulloblastoma  are not  eligible for  treatment  within  this 
protocol. 
 
4.2.2.   Desmoplastic   /   nodular   Medulloblastoma   and   Medulloblastoma   with   extensive 
Nodularity 
This medulloblastoma variant is characterized by nodular, reticulin-free tumour islands surrounded 
by areas with densely packed, proliferative tumour cells which produce a dense, intercellular reticulin 
fibre network. Even if this typical pattern is present only focally, a medulloblastoma specimen has to 
be  classified  as  desmoplastic  nodular  medulloblastoma.  The  islands  of  desmoplastic  /  nodular 
medulloblastomas  frequently  show  a  lower  mitotic  and  proliferative  activity  and  signs  of early 
neuronal  differentiation.  Cases  with  nodular  appearance  but  without  typical  fibre network  do  not 
qualify  for  the  diagnosis  of  desmoplastic  /  nodular  medulloblastoma.  Medulloblastomas  only 
showing an increased fibre content without the typical biphasic (island) pattern are not classified as 
desmoplastic   /   nodular   medulloblastomas.   Such   (unspecific)   fibre induction   may   occur   as 
desmoplastic reaction when tumours grow superficially within leptomeningeal areas. 
 
The related variant “Medulloblastomas with extensive nodularity” show a similar biphasic pattern as 
desmoplastic  nodular  medulloblastomas.  However,  the  reticulin-free  islands  with  lower  cellularity 
are enlarged and contain isomorphic neurocyte-like tumour cells with round nuclei and low mitotic 
activity embedded in a neuropil-like matrix. Immunohistochemically, these cells express markers of 
advanced neurocytic differentiation such as NeuN. These areas of advanced differentiation have to 
dominate  the  histology  to  qualify  a  case  for  the  diagnosis  of  medulloblastoma  with  extensive 
nodularity. The cells of the reticulin-rich areas resemble their counterparts in desmoplastic/nodular 
medulloblastomas. 
Medulloblastomas  with  extensive  nodularity  usually  only  occur in  very  young  children,  and  are 
associated  with  a  good  prognosis.(Rutkowski,  Bode  et  al.  2005;  Garre,  Cama  et  al.  2009) Patients 
with medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity are not eligible for treatment within this protocol. 
 
4.2.3. Classic Medulloblastoma 
Classic medulloblastomas are composed of densely packed small undiffentiated cells characterized 
by round to oval or ‘carrot-like’ hyperchromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasms. The mitotic activity is 
significantly elevated but may vary between different tumour areas. Some cases show the formation 
of  neuroblastic  (Homer-Wright)  rosettes.  Classic  medulloblastoma  lack  areas  with  the  typical 
biphasic reticulin / island pattern of desmoplastic / nodular medulloblastomas or medulloblastomas 
with  extensive  nodularity.  Some  cases  show  immunohistochemical  evidence  of early neuronal 
differentiation  such  as  synaptophysis  expression.  In  addition,  cells  with  astrocytic,  myogenic  or 
melanocytic   differentiation   may   be   found.   However,   advanced   astrocytic   or   ependymal 
differentiation  would  be  very  unusual  for  classic  medulloblastomas.  Marked  cytological  anaplasia 
such  as  high  nuclear  pleomorphism  may  occur  focally.  However,  diffuse  and  severe  cytological 
anaplasia  is  not  compatible  with  the  diagnosis  of  classic  medulloblastoma  but  qualifies  for  the 
diagnosis  of  anaplastic  medulloblastoma.  Similarly,  groups  of tumour cells  may  show  the  typical 
cytological features of large cell medulloblastomas. However if the histological picture is dominated 
by these cells, the diagnosis of a large cell medullobalstoma has to be made.

4.3. Molecular Markers and the Concept of Biological Risk Profile 
Medulloblastoma  (MB)  is  a  heterogeneous  disease  at  the  molecular  level  and  no  diagnostic 
cytogenetic or molecular abnormality has been identified. Nonetheless, a series of major non-random 
molecular genetic abnormalities have been identified in the human disease, which (i) have informed 
our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis and (ii) offer significant 
potential for improved treatment stratification and/or the identification of novel therapeutic targets. 
In particular, a number of consistent chromosomal abnormalities have been identified, as have critical 
oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, and an involvement for specific molecular pathways.  
 
4.3.1. Aberrations in Developmental Cell-signalling Pathways 
The  most  significant  insights  into  biological  pathways  involved  in  medulloblastoma  pathogenesis 
have  come  from  the  investigation  of  rare  familial  syndromes  that  predispose  to  medulloblastoma 
development. Although only a small proportion of medulloblastomas (<5%) are associated with an 
inherited  familial  predisposition,  many  of  the  genetic  defects  that  cause  these  syndromes  have 
subsequently been shown to play a more extensive role in sporadic medulloblastoma development. 
Mutations of TP53, APC and PTCH in sporadic medulloblastoma have been uncovered through their 
causative roles in Li-Fraumeni, Turcot and NBCC syndromes, respectively.(Malkin, Li et al. 1990; 
Evans, Farndon et al. 1991; Cogen, Daneshvar et al. 1992; Hamilton, Liu et al. 1995; Hahn, Wicking 
et al. 1996; Johnson, Rothman et al. 1996; Kleihues, Schauble et al. 1997; Paraf, Jothy et al. 1997; 
Pietsch,  Waha  et  al.  1997;  Raffel,  Jenkins  et  al.  1997;  Vorechovsky,  Tingby  et  al.  1997;  Wolter, 
Reifenberger et al. 1997; Huang, Mahler-Araujo et al. 2000; Koch, Waha et al. 2001) The APC and 
PTCH genes represent key components of the Wnt/Wingless (Wnt/Wg) and Sonic hedgehog (SHH) 
developmental  cell  signalling  pathways  (Figure  1),  respectively,  and  subsequent  studies  have 
identified extensive roles for both signalling cascades in the disease. Both pathways are essential in 
normal   neural   and   cerebellar   development   and   become   aberrantly   activated   in   subsets   of 
medulloblastomas.(Gilbertson and Ellison 2008)

Wingless (WNT) Signalling 
 
APC is an essential component of the canonical Wnt/Wg signalling pathway, which is necessary for 
normal  development,  including  roles  in  the  determination  of  neural  cell  fates.(Taipale  and  Beachy 
2001; Marino 2005) Briefly, the canonical Wnt/Wg pathway regulates intra-cellular localisation of 
-catenin,  a  key  transcriptional  activator  (Figure  1).  Stimulation  of  Wnt/Wg  signalling  leads -
catenin  to  translocate  to  the  nucleus,  transactivate  TCF/LEF  transcriptional  complexes,  and  up-
regulate  specific  downstream  pro-tumourigenic  target  genes  including  cyclin  D1  and MYC.(Morin 
1999; Clevers 2000; Taipale and Beachy 2001)
 
 
 
Aberrant  Wnt/Wg  activation  characterises  a  significant  sub-set  of  medulloblastomas.  At  the 
mutational  level,  approximately  10%  of  cases  contain  oncogenic  mutations  in  the CTNNB1 gene 
(which encodes -catenin). Mutations of alternative pathway components (APC, AXIN1 and AXIN2) 
each  affect  a  further  ~2.5%  of  cases,  but GSK3- mutations have  not  been  detected  where 
investigated.(Zurawel, Chiappa et al. 1998; Eberhart, Tihan et al. 2000; Huang, Mahler-Araujo et al. 
2000;  Dahmen,  Koch  et  al.  2001;  Koch,  Waha  et  al.  2001;  Baeza,  Masuoka  et  al.  2003) CTNNB1 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
35 
mutations  target  the GSK-3 phosphorylation  domain  of  its  protein,  resulting  in  its  constitutive 
stabilization,  nuclear  accumulation,  and  contribution  to  tumourigenesis.  Nuclear -catenin  protein 
stabilisation   thus   provides   a   comprehensive   indication   of   Wnt/Wg   pathway   activation   in 
medulloblastoma, and affects 18-30% of cases overall.(Eberhart, Tihan et al. 2000; Ellison, Onilude 
et  al.  2005) A  strong  relationship  is  observed  between CTNNB1 mutations  and  nuclear -catenin 
accumulation (by immunohistochemistry) in clinical samples, with CTNNB1 mutations detected in 
60-70%  of -catenin  nucleopositive  cases.(Eberhart,  Tihan  et  al.  2000;  Koch,  Waha  et  al.  2001; 
Ellison,  Onilude  et  al.  2005;  Clifford,  Lusher  et  al.  2006;  Fattet,  Haberler  et  al.  2009) While  rarer 
AXIN2 mutations have been associated with -catenin stabilization(Koch, Hrychyk et al. 2007), any 
relationship between the mis-sense APC or AXIN1 mutations that have been reported, and nuclear -
catenin  accumulation,  is  less  clear.  Mutations  of  the APC mutation  cluster  region  have  not  been 
observed   in -catenin   nucleopositive   sporadic   medulloblastoma   cases   which   lack CTNNB1 
mutations.(Ellison, Onilude et al. 2005) Mutations of further pathway components and/or alternative 
mechanisms  of  gene  inactivation  are  thus  likely  to  underlie -catenin  stabilisation  in  cases  which 
display protein accumulation in the absence of a detectable CTNNB1 mutation. 
 
Wnt/Wg  pathway  activation  defines  a  unique  molecular  sub-group  of  medulloblastomas,  which 
display  distinct  gene  expression  profiles,  patterns  of  genomic  abnormalities  and  clinical  outcome. 
Wnt/Wg  medulloblastomas  exhibit  a  characteristic  gene  expression  signature,  which  is mutually 
exclusive from expression signatures displayed by the SHH sub-group of tumours (below) and other 
medulloblastoma  expression  sub-groups.(Thompson,  Fuller  et  al.  2006).  Genomically,  Wnt/Wg-
active  medulloblastomas  appear  to  be  exclusively  associated  with  the  loss  of  an  entire  copy  of 
chromosome  6  in  the  majority  of  cases,  while  this  sub-group  is  independent  of  chromosome  17 
aberrations,  the  most  common  chromosomal  alterations  detected  in  medulloblastoma.(Clifford, 
Lusher  et  al.  2006;  Thompson,  Fuller  et  al.  2006) Moreover,  the  Wnt/Wg-active  medulloblastoma 
sub-group displays an idiosyncratic clinical behaviour, and -catenin status has been shown to be an 
independent  marker  of  favourable  clinical  outcome  (greater  than  90%  overall  survival)  across 
independent   clinical   trials-based   biological   studies.(Ellison,   Onilude   et   al.   2005;   Gajjar, 
Chintagumpala et al. 2006) Although Wnt/Wg-positive medulloblastomas tend to display classic or 
large-cell/anaplastic histology and arise in older children, they cannot be readily distinguished from 
other tumours that display equivalent clinical and histological features, and require identification at 
the  molecular  level.(Ellison,  Onilude  et  al.  2005;  Gajjar,  Chintagumpala  et  al.  2006;  Thompson, 
Fuller et al. 2006)
 
 
 
Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) Signalling 
 
The  SHH  pathway  plays  a  key  role  in  normal  cerebellar  development,  where  the  SHH  ligand  is 
secreted by Purkinje neurons and promotes mitogenesis in external granule layer (EGL) progenitor 
cells during early development.(Taipale and Beachy 2001; Wechsler-Reya and Scott 2001) Response 
to  the  SHH  signal  is  controlled  through  two  trans-membrane  proteins,  PTCH  and  its  associated 
protein ‘smoothened’ (SMO) (Figure 1). In the  absence  of  SHH  ligand,  PTCH  suppresses  SMO 
activity. Upon SHH stimulation, this inhibition is removed, leading to a SMO-induced transcriptional 
response, mediated by the activation and repression of target genes by the ‘GLI’ family of zinc-finger 
containing transcription factors (GLI-1, GLI-2, GLI-3). In human cells, suppressor of fused (SUFU), 
co-operates with BTRCP, to inhibit GLI-1-mediated transcription, however the mechanisms by which 
SMO  activation  is  coupled  to  nuclear  proteins  in  the  mammalian  SHH  pathway  are  otherwise  not 
well  understood.(Stone,  Murone  et  al.  1999;  Taipale  and  Beachy  2001;  Wechsler-Reya  and  Scott 
2001)
 
 
 
Aberrant SHH pathway activation by genetic mutation occurs in at least 15% of medulloblastomas, 
based  on  estimates  from  genetic  data,  and  arises  through  mutations  affecting  multiple  alternative 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
36 
pathway components. In addition to PTCH1 mutations (~10% of cases), SMO activating mutations 
have  been  reported  in  ~5%  of  cases. SUFU mutations  have  also  been  described,  although  their 
incidence  and involvement are likely to be lower  than initially reported (0-10% of cases).(Pietsch, 
Waha et al. 1997; Raffel, Jenkins et al. 1997; Vorechovsky, Tingby et al. 1997; Wolter, Reifenberger 
et al. 1997; Reifenberger, Wolter et al. 1998; Taylor, Liu et al. 2002; Koch, Waha et al. 2004) Notably, 
only specific SHH pathway components are affected by mutations, and mutations in other pathway 
components (e.g. SHH, BTRCP and other genes) have not been found where investigated.(Zurawel, 
Allen et al. 2000; Taylor, Liu et al. 2002; Wolter, Scharwachter et al. 2003)
 
 Genetic disruption of the 
SHH  pathway  results  in  inappropriate  constitutive  activation  of  the  signalling  cascade,  and 
downstream mitogenic effects most likely mediated through over-expression of GLI proteins, GLI-
dependent  target  genes  (including  PTCH  itself)  and  downstream  response  mediators  (e.g.  BMI-1, 
MYCN,  cyclin  D1).(Taipale  and  Beachy  2001;  Leung,  Lingbeek  et  al.  2004) A  recent  study  using 
unsupervised   hierarchical   cluster   analysis   of   expression   microarray   data   from a   series   of 
medulloblastomas  identified  a  sub-group  of  cases  associated  with  a  distinct  SHH-related  gene 
expression  profile,  characterized  by  the  over-expression  of  pathway  members  and  targets.  This 
expression cluster was consistent with SHH pathway activation in ~25% of medulloblastomas, and 
was highly associated with genetic mutations in SHH pathway components.(Thompson, Fuller et al. 
2006) The role of SHH in medulloblastoma tumourigenesis is further supported by observations that 
mice in which the SHH pathway is aberrantly activated develop cerebellar tumours that mimic human 
medulloblastoma  at  both  the  histological  and  gene  expression  level.  (e.g. Ptch
+/-
 or Ptch

, Tp53
-/- 
mice; Sufu
+/-
, Tp53
-/- 
mice; ND2:SmoA1 mice)(Goodrich, Milenkovic et al. 1997; Wetmore, Eberhart 
et al. 2000; Hallahan, Pritchard et al. 2004; Lee, Kawagoe et al. 2007) 
 
Aberrant   SHH   pathway   activation   appears   to   be   associated   with   development   of   the 
nodular/desmoplastic medulloblastoma histological sub-type. The majority of medulloblastomas in 
NBCCS  correspond  to  the  nodular/desmoplastic  variant.(Schofield,  West  et  al.  1995) Similarly, 
PTCH mutations, deletion of chromosome 9q elements, and SHH-associated gene expression profiles 
occur  preferentially  and  in  a  significant  proportion  (30-40%)  of  sporadic  nodular  /  desmoplastic 
medulloblastomas.(Schofield,  West  et  al.  1995;  Pietsch,  Waha  et  al.  1997;  Nicholson,  Ross  et  al. 
1999)
 
 SUFU mutations  have  also  been  reported  to  segregate  preferentially  with  nodular  / 
desmoplastic tumours.(Taylor, Liu et al. 2002). However, the relationship between SHH defects and 
nodular/desmoplastic  medulloblastomas  is  not  absolute  and  pathway  activation  is  also  observed  in 
classic and large cell/anaplastic tumours.(Wolter, Reifenberger et al. 1997; Thompson, Fuller et al. 
2006) Ongoing studies of tumours isolated from patients treated in the PNET 5 MB - LR and PNET 
5 MB - SR prospective clinical studies will aim to better define the relationship between histological 
subtype and molecular alterations. 
 
Additional Aberrant Cell Signals in Medulloblastoma 
 
Mutations  in PIK3CA,
 
a  member  of  the  family  of  phosphatidylinositol  3'-kinase  (PI3K)  signalling 
pathway,  have  been  reported  in  ~5%  of  medulloblastomas(Broderick,  Di  et  al.  2004),  and  suggest 
that PI3K, its pathway components and effectors may play a role in medulloblastoma
 
tumourigenesis. 
Other specific genetic targets have not been reported in the human disease. Abrogation of additional 
signalling  networks,  including  those  regulated  through  the  neurotrophin,  PDGFR  and  ERBB2 
receptor   families,   have   been   implicated   by   gene   expression   studies   in   human   primary 
medulloblastomas, however a genetic basis for their disruption has not yet been uncovered.(Grotzer, 
Janss et al. 2000; MacDonald, Brown et al. 2001; Gilbertson and Clifford 2003; Hernan, Fasheh et 
al. 2003; Gilbertson, Langdon et al. 2006)

4.3.2. Chromosomal Abnormalities and Gene Amplifications 
Abnormalities   of   chromosome   17   are   the   most   common   chromosomal aberrations   in   MB: 
isochromosome 17q (iso(17q)) is observed in approximately 40% of cases.(Bigner, Mark et al. 1988; 
Biegel, Rorke et al. 1989; Reardon, Michalkiewicz et al. 1997; Nicholson, Ross et al. 1999; Lamont, 
McManamy et al. 2004). Isolated loss of 17p is observed in an additional ~20% of cases.(Reardon, 
Michalkiewicz  et  al.  1997;  Nicholson,  Ross  et  al.  1999;  Gilbertson,  Wickramasinghe  et  al.  2001; 
Lamont, McManamy et al. 2004). Gain of chromosome 7 also occurs commonly and affects ~40% 
of cases. Extensive non-random losses of chromosomes 8, 9, 10q, 11 and 16q are each observed in 
~30% of cases.(Reardon, Michalkiewicz et al. 1997; Avet-Loiseau, Venuat et al. 1999; Nicholson, 
Ross et al. 1999)
 
 The specific genetic targets of most of these common chromosomal abnormalities 
remain to be identified. Mutations in PTCH (at 9q22.3), SUFU (10q24.3) and TP53 (17p13.1) have 
each been described in ~10% of tumours.(Cogen, Daneshvar et al. 1992; Pietsch, Waha et al. 1997; 
Raffel,  Jenkins  et  al.  1997;  Taylor,  Liu  et  al.  2002) Since  mutation  of  these  genes  occurs  far  less 
frequently  than  loss  of  the  corresponding  chromosomal  locus,  then  these  genes  might  be  haplo-
insufficient, inactivated by alternative mechanisms e.g., methylation, or located close to alternative 
tumour suppressor genes (TSGs). 
 
Double  minute  chromosomes  have  been  observed  in  cytogenetic  studies  of  MB,  and  gene 
amplification is a feature of a small subset of cases.(Bigner, Mark et al. 1988) MYCN (at 2p24) and 
MYC (at 8q24) genes are the most commonly amplified loci, which have been verified across multiple 
studies. Each occurs in 5 to 15% of medulloblastoma cases, and has been associated with the large-
cell/anaplastic  medulloblastoma  variant  and  an  adverse  clinical  prognosis.(Aldosari,  Bigner  et  al. 
2002;  Eberhart,  Kratz  et  al.  2002;  Lamont,  McManamy  et  al.  2004;  Pfister,  Remke  et  al.  2009) 
Additional  gene  amplifications  affecting  other  loci  are  rare  in  MB,  but  have  been  documented  in 
either single studies or in isolated cases. Genes affected include OTX2, NOTCH2, hTERT, MYCL1, 
PDGFRA, KIT, MYB, PPM1D and CDK6.(Fan, Wang et al. 2003; Fan, Mikolaenko et al. 2004; Boon, 
Eberhart et al. 2005; Di, Liao et al. 2005). The incidence and biological and clinical significance of 
these events require clarification. 
 
4.3.3. The Relationships between Biological Factors, Histology and Prognosis 
Only   clinical   variables   are   currently   used   in   the   therapeutic   stratification   of   patients   with 
medulloblastoma.  Molecular  markers  and  histopathological  subclassification  do not  currently 
influence  therapeutic  strategy.  However,  variability  in  outcome  exists  within  current  clinical  risk 
groups. The accurate identification of disease risk remains a major goal, as a more robust stratification 
of  disease-risk  would  facilitate  the  targeted  use  of  adjuvant  therapies;  intensive  regimens  for 
aggressive tumours and reduced long-term side effects for patients with more readily curable tumours. 
 
Assessment of the prognostic significance of molecular defects in medulloblastoma has frequently 
been  limited  by  the  retrospective  analysis  of  individual  markers  in  small,  heterogeneously  treated 
cohorts.  Nonetheless,  a  range  of  molecular  markers  with  prognostic  potential  have  now  been 
identified in trial-based studies (Table 1). Nuclear imunoreactivity of -catenin, indicative of Wnt/Wg 
pathway activation, has been consistently associated with a favourable outcome.(Ellison, Onilude et 
al. 2005; Gajjar, Chintagumpala et al. 2006) Amplification of the MYC oncogene has been associated 
with a poor prognosis in multiple studies(Lamont, McManamy et al. 2004; Rutkowski, von Bueren 
et al. 2007), while defects of chromosome 17(Lamont, McManamy et al. 2004), and expression of 
the ERBB2 receptor tyrosine kinase(Gajjar, Hernan et al. 2004), have each been associated with an 
adverse outcome in isolated studies. Other defects, such as expression of the MYC oncogene or the 
TRKC neurotrophin  receptor,  and  amplification  of  the MYCN oncogene,  have  shown  prognostic 
significance  in  some  studies,  but  have  not  had  demonstrable  value  in  others.(Gajjar,  Hernan  et  al. 
2004;  Lamont,  McManamy  et  al.  2004;  Rutkowski, von  Bueren  et  al.  2007) Initial  studies  in

individual cohorts indicate activation of the SHH pathway or associated defects (i.e. 9q loss) do not 
appear to have prognostic significance.(Lamont, McManamy et al. 2004; Gajjar, Chintagumpala et 
al. 2006)

Clinical studies in patients from the SIOP-UKCCSG PNET3 clinical trial which first established the 
prognostic  significance  of  the  WNT  subgroup  were  undertaken  on  patients  aged  <16.0  years  at 
diagnosis  (Ellison  et  al,  2005;  Ellison  et  al  2011)  and  a  recent large  retrospective  study  suggested 
WNT  subgroup  patients  have  a  bimodal  age  distribution  and  that  patients  greater  than  18  years  at 
diagnosis do not share the same favourable outlook (Korshunov et al, 2010). These data are supported 
by  initial  findings  from  the  HIT-SIOP  PNET4  trial,  in  which  WNT  subgroup patients  aged  <16.0 
years at diagnosis had significantly better outcomes than those aged ≥16.0 years (Events in 3/42 vs. 
3/10 patients respectively, p=0.01, log-rank test) 
 
Among  the  histopathological  variants  of  medulloblastoma,  an  aggressive  biological  behaviour  has 
been established for the overlapping large-cell and anaplastic variants, which have been associated 
with a poor outcome in several clinical trial cohorts.(Brown, Kepner et al. 2000; Eberhart, Kepner et 
al. 2002; McManamy, Lamont et al. 2003; Gajjar, Chintagumpala et al. 2006; McManamy, Pears et 
al.  2007) In  contrast,  the  MBEN,  which  is  a  tumour  of  infancy,  is  associated  with  a  good 
prognosis(Giangaspero,  Perilongo  et  al.  1999),  and  the  wider  desmoplastic  variant  (including 
MBENs) has consistently been associated with a more favourable outcome in trials-based studies in 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
39 
infants.(McManamy, Pears et al. 2007; Rutkowski, von Hoff et al. 2010) The desmoplastic variant 
has been reported to confer a more favourable(McManamy, Pears et al. 2007) or no difference(Gajjar, 
Chintagumpala et al. 2006) in prognosis, in trials studies of older children.  
 
While  there  is  clearly  overlap  between  high-risk  clinical,  pathological  and  molecular  variables, 
schema for stratifying medulloblastomas on the basis of combinations of these variables, which are 
predictive of high-, standard- and low-risk cases, are likely to allow a more targeted approach to the 
use  of  adjuvant  therapy  in  the  future.  Such  stratification  systems  now  require  development  and 
prospective  validation  in  large  group-wide  clinical  trials,  to  establish  any  applications  in  routine 
diagnostic  practice.  Moreover,  the  identification  of  additional  prognostic  disease  features,  through 
ongoing  biological  studies,  is  likely  to  facilitate  the  further  refinement of  the  precision  of  disease 
stratification systems. 
 
4.3.4. Rationale for Biological Testing  
In this study, the best validated biological prognostic criteria, based on current understanding, will be 
utilised  alongside  clinical  and  histopathological  indices,  in  order  to  define  the  low-risk  biological 
profile among standard-risk medulloblastomas, as well as to exclude cases with high-risk biological 
profiles from the standard-risk and low-risk medulloblastoma groups. In addition, biological studies 
attached to PNET 5 MB - LR and PNET 5 MB - SR will investigate the molecular pathology of MB, 
its  prognostic  significance  and  clinical  associations,  encompassing  investigations  of  established 
biological  features  of  medulloblastoma  and  the  characterisation  of  novel  disease  features.  The 
principal aim of these investigations will be (i) to improve our understanding of the molecular basis 
of MB, (ii) the identification of independent and informative prognostic markers for a more efficient 
patient stratification in future SIOP clinical trials, and (iii) the identification of targets for therapeutic 
exploitation. Studies in PNET 5 MB - LR will focus on the detailed biological characterisation of the 
low-risk biological sub-group. 
 
4.4. Risk-adapted Therapy 
4.4.1. Neurosurgery 
The  importance  of  the  role  of  surgical  resection  in  patients  with  medulloblastoma  is  widely 
recognised.  Neurosurgeons,  aided  by  modern  technological  adjuncts,  make  considerable  efforts  to 
achieve complete resection or near complete resection. Such surgery can bring an increased risk of 
neurological deficits of a temporary or  even  a permanent nature. Post-operative complications and 
neurological  deficits  resulting  from  surgery  not  only  impact  upon  quality  of  survival,  but  can  also 
contribute to delay in commencing adjuvant therapy. This may be compounded when neurosurgery 
takes place in one department and the adjuvant therapies are delivered in other departments, or even 
different institutions. There are, however, still few data on the toxicity of surgery, especially as patient 
related factors as the local anatomy, the behaviour of the tumour, and the presence of hydrocephalus 
and other surgical  factors (such  as  surgical  intent, technique,  and  the  use  of  high-technology 
instrumentation) are often overlapping. A  commonly  encountered  clinical  problem after surgery is 
the  posterior  fossa  syndrome.  Its  frequency  is  described  to  be  up  to  29%  of  medulloblastoma 
patients.(Robertson,  Muraszko  et  al.  2006;  Gudrunardottir,  Sehested  et  al.  2011) There  is  growing 
evidence  that  presence  and  severity  of  posterior  fossa  syndrome  after  surgery  is  associated  to  the 
neurological and neurocognitive long term outcome.(Palmer, Hassall et al. 2010; Wells, Khademian 
et  al.  2010)
 
Therefore, this problem will  be  assessed  within  this  study  in  addition  to  the standard 
neurosurgical questionnaire. .

4.4.2. Radiotherapy in Standard-risk Medulloblastoma 
Radiotherapy   remains a   key modality   in   the   curative   treatment   approach   of   patients   with 
medulloblastoma   (MB). Until   recently,   the   standard   therapeutic   approach   for   standard-risk 
medulloblastoma has consisted of complete or near total surgical resection followed by post-operative 
craniospinal  radiation  therapy  (CSRT). Given  the  propensity  of  MB  to  disseminate  via  the  CSF 
current standard practice in non-infants with confirmed MB requires adjuvant craniospinal irradiation 
with  a  boost  to  the  posterior  fossa/  primary  tumour  bed  as  part  the  curative  treatment  strategy. In 
Europe and the US the conventional doses of radiotherapy for standard risk patients in the past were 
35-36 Gy to the craniospinal axis followed by a whole posterior fossa boost up to a total dose of 54-
55.8 Gy. Recent studies have demonstrated that survival rates in patients who receive reduced-dose 
CSRT (in the range of 23.4 to 25 Gy) in combination with chemotherapy, are very high and often 
better  than those  for  patients  on  previous  studies  who  received a  higher  CSRT  dose without 
chemotherapy. Between  1990  and  1994  the  CCG  9892  pilot  study  recruited  patients  to  receive 
‘reduced dose’ craniospinal irradiation (23.4 Gy) with concurrent vincristine chemotherapy followed 
by adjuvant lomustine, vincristine and cisplatin chemotherapy. PFS rates of 86% at 3 years and 79% 
at 5  years were promising and hence this trial formed the basis for a Phase III trial (CCG A9961). 
This randomised trial included 379 standard risk MB patients treated with 23.4 Gy of craniospinal 
irradiation  followed  by  a  whole  posterior  fossa  boost  to  55.8  Gy.(Packer,  Gajjar  et  al.  2006) All 
patients received concurrent vincristine chemotherapy and were then randomised to receive one of 
two  adjuvant  chemotherapy  regimens:  lomustine,  vincristine  and  cisplatin  or cyclophosphamide, 
vincristine and cisplatin. EFS at 5 years was 81% and OS 86% with no difference between the two 
chemotherapy  arms.  This  was  the  first  prospective, randomised  study  to  demonstrate  an  excellent 
clinical  outcome  with  a  combined  modality  treatment  and ‘reduced-dose’ craniospinal  irradiation, 
and based on these data this radiotherapy schedule is now accepted as current ‘standard’ treatment. 
These results have been reproduced in Europe. In the M-SFOP 93 study, 136 patients with standard-
risk medulloblastoma were treated with CSRT to 25 Gy and posterior fossa radiation therapy (PFRT) 
to 55 Gy followed by chemotherapy.(Oyharcabal-Bourden, Kalifa et al. 2005) Five-year recurrence-
free survival was 64.8% ± 8.1% and overall survival was 73.8% ± 7.6%. The HIT-SIOP PNET 4 was 
designed to compare HFRT 1.0 Gy x 2 to 36, 60, 68 and 36 Gy respectively to the head, posterior 
fossa, tumour, and spine and conventional RT to 23.4, 54 and 23.4 Gy in patients with standard-risk 
MB. All patients also received adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin, CCNU and Vincristine. At a 
medium follow-up of 58 months, the overall 3 year EFS rate for 340 patients was 0.83±0.02 %. Based 
on these data at present the current recommended dose of RT for standard risk patents is 23.4 Gy to 
the CSA and 30.6 Gy to the posterior fossa. 
 
Late sequelae of RT 
It is well established that long-term survivors treated with radiotherapy for MB are at risk to suffer 
from  significant late  sequaelae,  including  cognitive  and  endocrine  deficits  as  well  as  hearing  loss. 
Although some of these late effects are related to the tumour itself, tumour associated hydrocephalus 
and the complications of both surgery and chemotherapy, RT is an important contributing factor in 
the pathogenesis of these late sequelae. Of most concern are the well-recognised neuropsychological 
sequelae of children receiving cranial irradiation. Several studies have demonstrated marked losses 
of IQ of up to 30 points or more which are most predominant in young children, particularly those 
less than seven or eight years of age.(Riva, Pantaleoni et al. 1989; Hoppe-Hirsch, Renier et al. 1990; 
Lannering, Marky et al. 1990) In a retrospective study, Grill et al showed that there is a significant 
correlation  between  the  full-scale  IQ  score  (FSIQ)  and  the  CSRT  dose,  with  mean  FSIQ  scores  at 
84.5,  76.9  and  63.7  for  0  Gy  (i.e.  posterior  fossa  radiotherapy  alone),  25  Gy  and  35  Gy  of  CSRT 
respectively.(Grill, Renaux et al. 1999) An analysis of the neuropsychological sequelae reported in 
the literature(Miralbell, Lomax et al. 1997) has been used to construct a dose response curve, which 
relates to the probability of neuropsychological sequelae to the brain RT dose. This pooling of data 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
41 
suggests a dose-response effect with greater morbidity seen with increasing cranial RT dose. Only 
one  study  has  attempted  to  examine  the  dose  effect  in  the  context  of  a  randomised  control  trial. 
Mulhern    examined    the    neuropsychological    functioning    of    survivors    of    children    with 
medulloblastoma  entered  in  the  POG  8631/CCG  923  study.(Mulhern,  Kepner  et  al.  1998) This 
showed that  children treated with 23.4 Gy CSRT experience less neuropsychological toxicity than 
those treated with 36 Gy CSRT. However, the number of patients studied was small, the individual 
patient  IQ  changes  varied  considerably  and  the  results  of  the  cross-sectional  analysis  were  not 
confirmed on a longitudinal basis. In the recent CCG 9892 study, the neuropsychological effect of 
23.4 Gy CSRT was reported to be a decline of 4.3 Full Scale IQ points per year.(Ris, Packer et al. 
2001) The median interval between radiotherapy and the patient’s most recent evaluation in that study 
was 2.5  years. The declines in  IQ were reported  to be relatively more marked in females, children 
with  higher  baseline  scores  and  children  aged  less  than  7  years.  The  authors  considered  that  their 
findings  were  suggestive  of  some  degree  of  intellectual  preservation  compared  to  the  effect  of 
conventionally dosed radiotherapy but also stated that the estimated decline in IQ of 20.8 points in 
their younger group did not clearly support an advantage to these patients for the reduced radiotherapy 
regimen. 
 
In  addition,  it  is  well  documented  that  the  majority  of  survivors  suffer  growth  and  endocrine 
dysfunction  predominately  due  to  irradiation  of  the  pituitary  gland  and  hypothalamic  axis  in 
combination with the effects of whole spine radiotherapy.(Pasqualini, Diez et al. 1987; Schmiegelow, 
Lassen et al. 1999; Adan, Sainte-Rose et al. 2000) Although exact dose effect relationships are not 
known,  there  is  evidence  to  suggest  that  dose  reduction  might  decrease the  risk  for  such 
hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunctions as well as for decreasing the risk for growth retardation of the 
spine. Moreover, radiotherapy of the spinal axis may contribute to a risk of gonadal dysfunction in 
young girls caused by scatter irradiation. 
 
Rationale for lowering the craniospinal dose in the LR arm of the PNET 5 MB study. 
The current 5y EFS of standard risk medulloblastoma in children above 3-5 years is around 80% with 
the current treatment using 23.4 Gy craniospinal radiotherapy, local boost up to 54 Gy and standard 
chemotherapy regimen  (Lannering et al. J Clin Oncol 2012, Packer et al. J Clin Oncol 2006).  Among 
this  standard  risk  medulloblastoma  group  of  patients,  the  very  good  prognosis  of  the  WNT 
medulloblastoma subgroup was already reported (Ellison et al., J Clin Oncol 2005, Thompson J Clin 
Oncol 2006) and has been confirmed in several recently published studies and reviews (Kool, Acta 
Neuropathol. 2012, Robinson et al., Nature 2012, Taylor et al. Acta Neuropathol. 2012). This is also 
prospectively confirmed  in the HIT-SIOP-E PNET 4 study (Clifford et al. submitted), for children 
younger than 16  years old.  However, the  good prognosis of the WNT medulloblastoma subgroup 
does not seem to be confirmed in adults (Korshunov J Clin Oncol 2010). The good prognosis of WNT 
medulloblastoma  in  children  younger  than  16  years  allows  the  initiation  of  a  prospective  study 
evaluating reduced intensity treatments in order to reduce late effects in this specific subgroup. 
 
Previous studies of the toxicity of craniospinal dose on neurocognitive functions have shown a clear 
dose-effect relationship. This has been the rationale to decrease the craniospinal dose from 36 to 23.4 
Gy in standard risk medulloblastoma, establishing better cognitive outcome after craniospinal dose 
reduction (Mulhern J Clin Oncol 2005, Grill Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1999). Further de-escalation 
of craniospinal dose from 23.4 to 18 Gy is also expected to allow a better cognitive function in the 
years following treatment. 
 
Finally,  the  current  methods  to  attest  the  WNT  medulloblastoma  subgrouping  in  the  context  of  a 
prospective multicentric international trial have improved, which allows to increase the specificity of 
WNT subgrouping.   Indeed, the  criteria  chosen  by the SIOP-E PNET biology  group  are no longer 
only based on immunohistochemistry, showing stabilisation of nuclear β catenin expression. Current 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
42 
criteria also incorporate molecular diagnosis either with direct β catenin mutation assessment, or 
indirect WNT subgrouping based on the documentation of somatic monosomy 6, as recommended in 
a recent international consensus (Gottardo, Acta Neuropathol 2013).   
 
Thus,  reduced  intensity  treatment  using  a  reduced  craniospinal  dose  in  well  characterised  WNT 
medulloblastoma subgroup  is  highly  justified  within  the  context  of  the  multicentric  international 
prospective  clinical  phase  II  PNET5  LR  trial.  Such  a  craniospinal  dose  reduction  is  currently 
performed in the ongoing St.-Jude study (SJMB12, opened in 2013) and is planned in the next COG 
protocol.    More  experimental  strategy  trying  to  avoid  any  radiation  on  the  WNT  medulloblastoma 
patients  has  not  been  chosen  by  the  SIOP-E  medulloblastoma/PNET  working  group  because  the 
WNT subgrouping could be in fact a marker of radiosensitivity, and because there is no demonstration 
of the efficacy of salvage therapy in case of relapse after first line treatment without radiation. 
 
Radiotherapy Technique 
Given the continuing refinement of treatment techniques quality control is a major factor in ensuring 
that  the  improved  survival  rates  are  maintained,  since  both  patient  evaluation  and  standards  of 
radiotherapy applied have been shown to correlate with outcome. In the HIT’91 study, patients who 
were fully assessable, i.e. with central histopathological review and complete staging, had higher EFS 
and  overall  survival  rates.(von  Hoff,  Hinkes  et al.  2009) The  above-mentioned  study  by  the 
Children’s  Oncology  Group  similarly  found  a  higher  EFS  rate  in  patients  who  had  central 
pathological  review,  including  determination  of  tumour  sub-type,  and  cytology  of  lumbar  CSF,  as 
well  as  neuro-imaging,  to evaluate  extent  of  disease  and  post-operative  residual  tumour.(Packer, 
Gajjar  et  al.  2006) In  the  M-SFOP  93  study  described  above,  quality  control  of  RT,  performed  a 
posteriori, found that relapse occurred in 67% of patients who had three or more major deviations. In 
the  M-SFOP  98  study,  quality  control  of  RT  was  used  prospectively  to  detect  major  protocol 
deviations and to correct them prior to treatment start, so as to limit the rate of relapse due to targeting 
deviations.(Carrie, Grill et al. 2009) Nine of the 14 deviations detected on QC were corrected before 
treatment,  leading  to  a  marked  reduction  in  the  number  of  relapses.  The  same  approach  to  quality 
control of radiotherapy was used in the HIT-SIOP PNET 4 study and will be used in PNET 5 MB. 
Given the pivotal role of radiotherapy quality control of RT is of particular importance when complex 
treatment techniques are involved and hence the intended upfront RT quality control of the CSRT.   
 
Reducing the risk of late sequelae associated with radiotherapy in patents with MB can be achieved 
by  either  reducing dose  or target volumes.  In the past the boost volume of the posterior fossa was 
defined  as  the  whole  posterior  fossa.  Increasingly  more  conformal  approaches  are  employed.  In 
conformal PF RT, as reported e.g. by Merchant et al., the radiation beam is shaped to “conform” to 
the profile of the primary tumour bed with a defined additional margin, thereby reducing toxicity to 
surrounding normal tissues (e.g. cochlea and mesotemporal lobe). Strict targeting guidelines in the 
study  allowed  for  a  reduction  in  the  volume  of  the  posterior  fossa  irradiated  of,  on  average, 
13%.(Merchant,  Kun  et  al.  2008) The  cumulative  incidence  of  local  failures  at  5  years  was  4.9%, 
which is similar to the rate in patients treated with irradiation to the entire posterior fossa. In addition, 
the  same  group suggested  a  dose  response  relationship  for  ototoxicity  in  patients  receiving  RT 
alone.(Hua, Bass et al. 2008) The data of 78 patients treated for posterior fossa/ suprasellar localised 
brain tumours with focal RT suggested a beginning high frequency hearing loss at doses over 30 Gy 
and intermediate to low frequency loss starting at doses over 40 Gy. High tone hearing loss was 2 % 
at 35 Gy and 5% at 45 Gy, with intermediate tone hearing loss 1 and 1.5%at 45 Gy respectively. In 
the  M-SFOP  98  study,  reduced-dose  CSRT  was  not  used,  however  the  conformal  approach  was 
similarly employed to reduce the boost volume. No relapses were observed within the posterior fossa 
outside the boost volume. Similar findings have been reported by other groups (Wolden, Dunkel et 
al. 2003; Douglas, Barker et al. 2004; Carrie, Grill et al. 2009), suggesting that adequate local control 
can be achieved by a primary tumour boost with a target volume being less than the previously used 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
43 
whole posterior fossa. The current phase 3 POG study compares in a prospective randomised fashion 
if  the  conventional  whole  posterior  fossa  boost  can  be  reduced  to  a  focal  approach  defining  the 
planning target volume as tumour bed plus a defined 3D margin.  
 
To maximise the outcome for patients with MB, radiotherapy should be delivered within 45-50 days 
in order to avoid a negative impact on event-free and overall survival.  
 
The  close  relationship  between  EFS  and  a  prolonged  total  treatment  time  of  RT  has  been  firstly 
described by del Charco et al.(del Charco, Bolek et al. 1998) This finding has been confirmed by the 
HIT-SIOP PNET-3 and 4 studies.(Taylor, Bailey et al. 2003). Hence treatment interruptions due to 
e.g. haematological toxicity should be avoided if patients can be appropriately supported with blood 
products or haematological growth factors. 
 
The role of hyperfractionated radiation therapy (HFRT) in the treatment of MB is currently debated. 
The M-SFOP 98 study was designed to explore HFRT in the context of prospective quality control. 
Conventional dose fractionation generally uses one fraction per day, five days per week, with a daily 
dose fraction in the range of 1.5 to 2.0 Gy. HFRT involves giving a smaller dose per fraction, with 
fractions administered at least twice a day, usually 6 to 8 hours apart. The total radiotherapy dose is 
increased, but in smaller doses, and the therapeutic ratio is improved, either by enhancing the anti-
tumour effect, with no increase in late effects, or by maintaining the anti-tumour effect and reducing 
late  effects.  In  the  M-SFOP  98  study,  both  CSRT  (36  Gy)  and  conformal  PFRT  (32  Gy)  were 
administered  in  fractions  of  1  Gy,  twice  per  day,  with  good  results  in  terms  of  EFS  and  cognitive 
outcomes, although it is not possible to determine whether the latter are related to hyperfractionation, 
reduced    boost    volume    through    the    conformal    approach,    or    the    absence    of    adjuvant 
chemotherapy.(Carrie, Grill et al. 2009) At present, the available data from HIT-SIOP PNET 4 do 
not  suggest  any  overall  or  event-free  survival  advantage  of  the  hyperfractionated  arm.(Lannering, 
Rutkowski et al. 2012) Hence the basis for the current study will be conventional fractionated CSRT 
as described above. 
 
Nowadays,  innovative  treatment  tecniques  are  increasingly  explored  to  lower  the  burden  of  late 
toxicity. Proton beam therapy seems to be partcicularly of interest. Early evaluation report promising 
results of early and late toxicity and comparative planning studies demonstrate lower dose to normal 
brain  and  inner  ear  for  posterior  fossa  irradiation  when  compared  to  photon  modalities.  However, 
prospective  data,  quality  of  life  analysis  and  long  term  evaluation  are  needed  to  prove  clinical 
superiority.(Kirsch and Tarbell 2004; Yuh, Loredo et al. 2004; Bjork-Eriksson and Glimelius 2005; 
Lee, Bilton et al. 2005; Cochran, Yock et al. 2008; MacDonald, Safai et al. 2008)  
 
 
4.4.3. Chemotherapy in Standard-risk Medulloblastoma 
Medulloblastoma is clearly a chemosensitive tumour, as demonstrated in numerous phase-II studies 
for relapse (Allen, Walker et al. 1987; Gaynon, Ettinger et al. 1990; Lefkowitz, Packer et al. 1990; 
Gentet,  Doz  et  al.  1994;  Ashley,  Meier  et  al.  1996) or  in  the  initial  treatment  of  metastatic 
disease.(Kovnar, Kellie et al. 1990; Strauss, Killmond et al. 1991) 
 
Over  the  last  25  years,  a  number  of  multicentre  studies  have  addressed  the  role  of  adjuvant 
chemotherapy  in  order  to  improve  survival  in  medulloblastoma  and,  more  recently,  to  facilitate  a 
reduction in the dose of CSRT. The North American CCG-942 (1976-1981) study compared RT alone 
(craniospinal  dose  35-40  Gy)  with  RT  followed  by  chemotherapy  (vincristine,  CCNU,  and 
prednisolone).  Overall,  for  the  223  children  entered  in  the  study,  5-year  progression  free  survival 
(PFS) was 55%.(Evans, Jenkin et al. 1990) Although there was no statistical difference in survival 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
44 
between  the  two  treatment  groups,  in  the  group  of  patients  with  high- risk  disease,  those  children 
randomised to receive post-RT chemotherapy had a PFS of 46% and an overall survival (OS) of 57% 
as compared to those treated with RT alone who had a PFS of zero and OS of 19%. 
 
In the SIOP 1 study (1975-1980), which was similar in design, 286 patients were randomised to RT 
alone (CRST dose 30-35 Gy) or RT plus chemotherapy with CCNU and vincristine. As with the CCG 
942 study, there was no significant difference in survival between the two groups, however a benefit 
for  chemotherapy  in  terms  of  improved  survival  was  noted  for  a  subgroup  of patients  who  had 
metastatic disease, subtotal resection, brain stem invasion and Chang Stage T3 and T4 disease.(Tait, 
Thornton-Jones et al. 1990) In summary, both these first-generation randomised studies, as well as 
non-randomised studies (Packer, Sutton et al. 1991; Bouffet, Gentet et al. 1994; Gentet, Bouffet et al. 
1995; Pezzotta, Cordero di Montezemolo et al. 1996), suggested  a benefit for chemotherapy  given 
after radiotherapy in patients with high-risk features. 
 
The next generation of studies focused on investigation of the timing of chemotherapy, particularly 
the use of pre-RT chemotherapy or so called ‘sandwich chemotherapy’. In the SIOP 2 study described 
above,  no  benefit  was  seen  for  sandwich  chemotherapy  prior  to  35  Gy  CRST,  and  a  decrease  in 
survival  was  seen  for  patients  treated  with  chemotherapy  before  reduced  dose  CRST  of  25 
Gy.(Bailey, Gnekow et al. 1995) 
 
In  the  SIOP  PNET  3  study  (1992-2000),  patients  with  standard-risk  medulloblastoma  were 
randomised to receive immediate radiotherapy alone or ‘sandwich chemotherapy’ consisting of a 
twelve-week regimen of four pulses of chemotherapy, two courses each of carboplatin and etoposide 
alternating with cyclophosphamide and etoposide. The radiotherapy dose was 35 Gy CSRT, which 
was  based  on  the  early  results  from  SIOP  2  that  suggested  an  overall  benefit  for  conventional  as 
opposed  to  reduced-dose  radiotherapy.  The  results  of  PNET  3  again  showed  the  benefit  of 
chemotherapy.(Taylor,  Bailey  et  al.  2003) A  significant  difference  in  EFS  was  demonstrated  for 
patients  treated  by  chemotherapy  and  RT  at  3  and  5  years  with  an  EFS  of  78.7%  and  73.4% 
respectively compared with 64.2% and 60.0% for RT alone (p=0.0419). The 3-year and 5-year OS 
for the two arms were 82.1% and 76.1% for patients treated with chemotherapy and RT, compared 
with 75.8% and 66.5% for treatment with RT alone (p = 0.1662). For patients who had undergone 
total resection, event-free survival was significantly better with chemotherapy + RT than RT alone 
(p=0.0346). 
 
Further randomised studies have compared pre-RT with post-RT chemotherapy. The German study 
HIT  ’91  compared  ‘sandwich  chemotherapy’  to  immediate  RT  followed  by  maintenance 
chemotherapy with the ‘Packer regimen’ of CCNU, vincristine and cisplatin.(Kortmann, Kuhl et al. 
2000) This regimen’, consisting of eight doses of vincristine, given during RT, followed  by  eight 
cycles  of  all  three  drugs  given  every  six  weeks,  commencing  six  weeks  after  the  end  of  RT,  had 
previously  been  investigated  in  the  context  of  reduced-dose  RT  CRST  of  23.4  Gy  with  a  boost  of 
31.8 Gy  (total dose to posterior fossa 55.2 Gy) in carefully-staged standard-risk patients. PFS was 
86% ±4% at 3 years and 79% ±7% at five years.(Packer, Goldwein et al. 1999) In the HIT ’91 study, 
the CSRT dose was 35.2 Gy and the posterior fossa dose was 55.2 Gy. There was an advantage for 
maintenance post-RT chemotherapy as compared to the ‘sandwich chemotherapy” with relapse-free 
survival of 78% versus 65% at three years for non-metastatic patients. 
 
Despite initial enthusiasm for “sandwich chemotherapy”, no studies to date have shown a benefit for 
this  approach  as  compared  to  post-RT  chemotherapy.  In  addition,  studies  such  as  SIOP  2  show  a 
possible detrimental effect of delaying radiotherapy. Subsequent interest has focused on the role of 
post-RT chemotherapy in the context of reduced-dose RT. 
 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17

The “Packer regimen” was compared to cisplatin, vincristine and cyclophosphamide in a recent study 
in children with standard-risk MB treated with reduced-dose CSRT.(Packer, Gajjar et al. 2006) Five-
year EFS and overall survival were found to be similar in the two  groups  at 82% ±2.8%  and 87% 
±2.69% compared to 80% ±3.1% and 85% ±2.8% in the CCNU-containing and cyclophosphamide-
containing  arms  respectively.  Toxicity,  probably  due  to  cisplatin,  was  again  a  major  concern,  as 
almost one quarter of patients in both arms experienced Grade 3 or 4 audiological toxicity. 
 
This  study  and  others confirmed  the  role  of  post-RT  chemotherapy  in  what  has  now  become  the 
treatment  standard  for  patients  with  standard-risk  MB,  i.e.  CSRT  in  the  range  of  23.4  to  25  Gy 
followed by PFRT. Indeed, coverage with post-RT chemotherapy may be a requisite part of the new 
treatment standard. 
 
Post-RT  maintenance  chemotherapy  has  also  been  studied  in  the  context  of  fractionated  and 
hyperfractionated RT regimens as an integral part of the overall therapeutic strategy. In the PNET 4 
study, comparing conventionally fractionated RT and HFRT, all patients received chemotherapy with 
vincristine  during  RT,  followed  by  eight  courses  of  cisplatin,  CCNU  and  vincristine.(Lannering, 
Rutkowski et al. 2012) Significant  acute toxicities were mainly reported during  chemotherapy and 
were not related to the type of RT received. In PNET 5 MB - LR, post-RT maintenance chemotherapy 
will include only six treatment cycles, three cycles of cisplatin, CCNU and vincristine in alternation 
with three cycles of cyclophosphamide and vincristine. 
 
The  use  of  HFRT  alone,  without  additional  chemotherapy,  also  showed  promising  results,  in  the 
context  of  strict  upfront  quality  control  of  radiotherapy.(Carrie,  Muracciole  et  al.  2005) However, 
there was only a limited number of patients treated. The rates of 6 year EFS and OS were 75% and 
78%, respectively, showing promising but slightly inferior long term results than comparable studies 
with chemotherapy.(Carrie, Grill et al. 2009) 
 
4.4.4. Rationale for Chemotherapy 
Rationale for Carboplatin as concomitant treatment to radiotherapy in PNET 5 MB - SR 
According   to the   results   from   the   PNET   4   study,   5-year   EFS   for   children   with   standard 
medulloblastoma  without  a  favourable  biological  profile  may  be  around  75%.  At  relapse,  possible 
salvage strategies after primary therapy have yielded relatively poor results. Therefore, a randomised 
study of intensification of primary therapy is appropriate. Considering possible strategies to intensify 
treatment, the following aspects have to be taken into account. Firstly, radiotherapy may be placed 
most effectively  as the first adjuvant treatment element after tumour resection, since a randomised 
comparison with sandwich chemotherapy in HIT’91 revealed significantly better survival rates for 
postoperative radiotherapy followed by maintenance chemotherapy.(Kortmann, Kuhl et al. 2000; von 
Hoff,  Hinkes  et  al.  2009) Secondly,  eight  cycles  of  maintenance  chemotherapy  with  CCNU, 
vincristine and cisplatin cannot be adminstered without dose modifications in a significant portion of 
children(von Hoff, Hinkes et al. 2009) and therefore an intensification of maintenance chemotherapy 
may not be feasible. Thirdly, the relapse pattern in PNET 4 was predominantly metastatic, suggesting 
that intensification of the neuroaxis treatment may contribute to improve survival rates. And finally, 
an increase in the craniospinal dose from 23.4 Gy to higher doses, which could potentially increase 
the associated neurocognitive deficits, should be avoided. All these aspects support the potential role 
of addition  of  chemotherapy  within  the  radiotherapy  phase as  a  method  of moderate  treatment 
intensification.  
 
The anti-tumour activity of cisplatin has been reported in childhood medulloblastoma.(Packer 1999) 
However, drug-induced toxicities have limited its clinical application. In order to further improve the 
therapeutic index, a number of platinum analogues, including carboplatin, have been synthesised. The 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
46 
use of carboplatin provides the opportunity to reduce nephro- and ototoxicities. However, carboplatin 
does have dose-limiting haematological toxicities. 
 
Carboplatin  has  been  suggested as  a potential  agent  for  treatment  intensification  additional to 
radiotherapy.(Douple, Richmond et al. 1985; Groen, Sleijfer et al. 1995) 
 
Comparing  cisplatin  with  carboplatin  from  a  pharmacokinetic  point  of  view,  carboplatin  is  less 
rapidly bound to plasma proteins, has a longer free platinum half-life and penetrates more efficiently 
into  brain  tissue,  thus  representing  an  attractive  platinum  analogue  for  the  treatment  of  brain 
tumours.(Doz  and  Pinkerton  1994) Following  IV  administration  of  maximally  tolerated  doses  of 
carboplatin  and  cisplatin  in  mice,  the  platinum  concentration  and  the  tissue-to-plasma  ratio  in  the 
brain was higher after carboplatin than after cisplatin.(Siddik, Jones et al. 1988) 
 
Based on these findings, phase I/II studies were conducted using carboplatin alone (Bacha, Caparros-
Sison et al. 1986; Allen, Walker et al. 1987) and showed mild toxicities, with a lower potential for 
auditory, renal, and emetic toxicities. Two phase I/II studies, analysing the feasibility of carboplatin 
combined  with  radiotherapy  in  malignant  brain  stem  gliomas  demonstrated  the  feasibility  of 
administration of carboplatin once or twice per week. However, response and survival rates were not 
different compared to other approaches.(Allen, Siffert et al. 1999; Doz, Neuenschwander et al. 2002) 
 
The  phase  I/II  study  COG  99701,  open  to  recruitment  of  patients  from  March  1998  to  November 
2004 for children with newly diagnosed high-risk PNET (3.1-18.2 years), investigated the feasibility 
of  carboplatin  given  5  days  a  week  simultaneously  to  dose-intensive  craniospinal  and  local 
radiotherapy along with weekly vincristine, followed by maintenance chemotherapy. Myelotoxicity 
was determined as the dose-limiting toxicity, and 35 mg carboplatin/m
2
/dose x 30 was the maximum 
tolerated  dose.  Ototoxicity  was  acceptable  (Jakacki, Burger  et  al.  2012)  and  other  toxicities  were 
moderate and, of note, no unacceptable rates of hearing deficits during or after chemoradiotherapy 
have so far been reported in that study. Preliminary survival rates reported for children with metastatic 
medulloblastoma treated with this regimen were promising. Thus, daily administration of carboplatin 
investigated in a randomised setting appears to be a suitable strategy in patients with medulloblastoma 
without  a  favourable  biological  profile,  where  moderate  intensification of  treatment  is  deemed 
appropriate. In this cohort of patients with non-metastatic medulloblastoma, it was decided to choose 
a daily dose of 35 mg carboplatin/m
2
/dose x 30 with radiotherapy, a dose that was shown to achieve 
cytotoxic drug levels in preclinical models and identified as the MTD in the 99701 trial with more 
intensive  radiotherapy  doses.  During  radiochemotherapy,  G-CSF  support  is  not  recommended 
routinely, but may be required if WBC falls below the levels indicated. 
 
Carboplatin  given  concomitantly  to  radiotherapy  might  potentially  increase  the  rate  of  ototoxicity, 
neurological  toxicities  and  neurocognitive  deficits.  Trials  which  used  the  cisplatin-containing 
‘Packer’ chemotherapy reported high to low rates of relevant ototoxicity (Packer 1994: 47% Grade 
II/IV (Packer,  Sutton  et  al.  1994);  COG  9961:  23%,  and  28%,  respectively  Grade  III/IV (Packer, 
Gajjar et al. 2006); HIT 91: 9% Grade III/IV (Kortmann, Kuhl et al. 2000)) Due to the use of different 
scales  for  grading  of  ototoxicity,  different  dose  modification  scemes,  and different  timepoints  of 
evaluation,  the  results  cannot  be  well  compared. However,  a  proactive  recommendation  for  dose-
modifications (substitution of cisplatin by carboplatin or stopping further use of any platinum-based 
compounds) should be instituted.  
In PNET 4, 12% of patients had III/IV ototoxicity within the first year after treatment, confirming the 
observation that early dose modification of cisplatin chemotherapy may reduce the rate of ototoxicity. 
In PNET  5  MB - SR,  significantly  lower  cumulative  doses  of  cisplatin  will  be  given  during 
maintenance chemotherapy. Therefore, a randomised study of the addition of carboplatin is deemed 
acceptable.  However,  guidelines  for  monitoring  of  hearing function before,  during,  and after 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
47 
treatment, and a stopping rule  for an unacceptable rate of ototoxicity has  been implemented in the 
statistical design of PNET 5 MB - SR. For grading of ototoxicity the Chang grading will be used (see 
9.4.2. Audiology, page 72. 
Due  to  the  potential  enhancement  of  neurological  toxicities  of  the  radiotherapy,  there  will  be  a 
prospective   evaluation   of   leucencephalopathy,   based   on   estimation   of   national   reference 
neuroradiologists. Furthermore, there will be a structured evaluation of clinical neurological follow-
up.  
 
Rationale for Maintenance Chemotherapy  
It  has  been  shown  that  eight  cycles  of  maintenance  chemotherapy  with  CCNU,  vincristine  and 
cisplatin cannot be applied without dose modifications in a significant portion of children.(von Hoff, 
Hinkes  et  al.  2009) In  HIT’91,  this  maintenance  chemotherapy  was  administered  to  62  fully 
assessable  patients  with  M0  or  M1  disease.  Overall  survival  of  patients  with  and  without  dose 
reductions  due  to  toxicity  was  not  different.  Ten-year  OS  rates  were  80%  (±  11%)  for  16  patients 
without  any  dose  reduction  and  88%  (±  5%)  for  40  patients  with  dose  reduction  (p=0.585).  In 
addition, the introduction of carboplatin in PNET 5 MB - SR with radiotherapy has prompted us to 
reduce  the  cumulative  dose  of  cisplatin  in  the  maintenance  chemotherapy  in  order  to  avoid  an 
unacceptable  rate  of  ototoxicity.  Consequently,  it  was  decided  to  reduce  the  cumulative  doses  of 
cisplatin,  CCNU  and  vincristine  given  during  maintenance  chemotherapy  in PNET  5  MB - LR (6 
cycles  ABABAB)  and PNET  5  MB - SR (8  cycles  ABABABAB).  A  backbone  of  cycles  with 
cisplatin,   CCNU   and   vincristine   (Regimen   A,   3   or   4   cycles,   respectively)   was   chosen. 
Cyclophosphamide  is  an  active  agent  in  medulloblastoma.(Friedman,  Mahaley  et  al.  1986) Cycles 
with cyclophosphamide and vincristine (Regimen B), well tolerated in the HIT-SKK protocols since 
the early 1990s(Rutkowski, Bode et al. 2005), have been adopted as alternating B cycles in PNET 5 
MB - LR and PNET  5  MB - SR.  As  shown  in  the  table  below,  the  cumulative  doses  of  cisplatin, 
CCNU  and  vincristine  are  significantly  lower  compared  to  PNET 4  and  HIT91  maintenance 
chemotherapy, aiming to improve the feasibility of applying this maintenance chemotherapy without 
further significant dose-reductions.

4.5. Late Effects and Quality of survival 
It is widely recognized, that long term survivors after diagnosis and therapy for medulloblastoma are 
suffering   from   multidimensional   impairments. Survivors   typically   experience   neurological, 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
48 
endocrine  and  other  health  problems (Ribi,  Relly  et  al.  2005; Laughton,  Merchant  et  al.  2008; 
Benesch, Spiegl et al. 2009; Boman, Hoven et al. 2009; Frange, Alapetite et al. 2009). They also have 
school  difficulties  during  childhood (Ribi,  Relly  et  al.  2005).  In  adulthood  they  experience 
psychosocial  difficulties  related  to  employment,  driving,  independent  living  and  marital  status 
(Maddrey,  Bergeron  et  al.  2005; Frange,  Alapetite  et  al.  2009).  There  is  also  evidence  of social 
isolation (Ribi, Relly et al. 2005); neurocognitive problems (Maddrey, Bergeron et al. 2005; Mulhern, 
Palmer et al. 2005; Ribi, Relly et al. 2005; Merchant, Kiehna et al. 2006; Nagel, Delis et al. 2006; 
Reeves, Palmer et al. 2006; Benesch, Spiegl et al. 2009) ; neurobehavioural difficulties (Roncadin, 
Dennis et al. 2008); and compromised QoL (Ribi, Relly et al. 2005; Benesch, Spiegl et al. 2009).) 
Craniospinal  irradiation  (CSI)  is  an  important  determinant  of  health  status  and  QoS  following 
medulloblastoma but post-operative status prior to adjuvant therapy and the addition of chemotherapy 
to CSI may compromise further late effects in older children and young adults (Bull, Spoudeas et al. 
2007).  It  is  therefore  important  that  the  appraisal  of  the  effect  of  allocation  to  treatments  in  RCTs 
includes systematic assessment of health status, quality of life and related aspects of QoS that may 
be affected including social and emotional difficulties, and cognitive and executive function. These 
outcomes  are  in  turn  likely  to  predict  the  extent  to  which  survivors  can  function  independently  in 
society.   
 
In order to achieve the numbers required for the necessary power to draw reliable conclusions, the 
methods used to collect outcome data need to be applicable in multiple centres across Europe. The 
over-riding concern is to keep assessments short and simple and the burden for families and clinicians 
low. The strategy for achieving this is to rely principally on short questionnaires to assess outcome 
in  a  systematic  way  that  includes  the  full  range  of  types  of  difficulties  and  disabilities  considered 
relevant by families: this will document health status, behaviour, endocrine and audiological function, 
and the subjective experience of the child and family.  
 
A modification of the assessment proposed by Glaser et al in 1999 proved feasible in a previous cross-
sectional multicentre study of UK survivors enrolled in PNET3 and detected important differences 
between  treatment  arms  in  children  treated  for  medulloblastoma.(Glaser,  Kennedy  et  al.  1999) In 
particular, use of chemotherapy ‘sandwiched’ between neurosurgery and cranio-spinal  irradiation 
(CSI) was associated with substantially poorer health status seven years later.(Bull, Spoudeas et al. 
2007) The  same  method  was  also  applied  longitudinally  in  seven  languages  across  all  centres 
participating in PNET 4 although there was fall-off in ascertainment for later (2-3 year) time points 
after diagnosis.  In PNET 5 MB - LR and PNET  5 MB - SR, we expect to improve ascertainment, 
compared to PNET 4, by making a similar panel of questionnaire assessments accessible to families 
on-line via personal computers, either in their homes or at the centres where they receive treatment. 
Online  documentation  can  be  performed within  HealthTracker®  (HT).  For  patients  with  limited 
online access also documentation within paper booklets will be possible. HealthTracker is an online 
site  (http://www.healthtracker.co.uk/Welcome.aspx?c=19)  that  has  been  specifically  developed  to 
capture a wide range of heath outcomes including, symptoms, side-effects, quality of life and quality 
of  survival.(Gringras,  Santosh  et  al.  2006) HealthTracker has  been  developed  through  workshops 
with  children,  young  people  and  their  parents  and  uses  an  engaging  and  fun  collection  of 
questionnaires and games to give it a ‘bedside manner’. The use of this on-line  adaptation  of  the 
method was piloted in 2013 and found to be acceptable to users. 
 
Much  of  the  variation  in  neuro-cognitive  outcome  following  acquired  brain  injury  is  unexplained, 
and part of this is attributable to host genetic factors. There is an extensive literature on the predictive 
value  of  allelic  variation  in  the  ApoE  gene,  Interleukin  (IL)  genes,  that  determine  a  pro- or  anti-
inflammatory  phenotype,  and  other  DNA polymorphisms  in  traumatic  brain  injury,(Dardiotis, 
Fountas et al.) but it is only recently that investigators have begun to explore the role of genetic factors 
in neuro-cognitive outcome following childhood brain tumours.  

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
49 
Dopamine  and  dopamine  degrading enzyme  catechol-o-methlyltransferease  (COMT)  are  critically 
important for functions mediated by frontal brain regions in healthy individuals. In 50 childhood brain 
tumour  survivors  treated  with  conformal  radiotherapy  and  40  healthy  siblings,  COMT  genotype 
predicted  performance  on  the  verbal  self-ordered  search  task  measure  of  working  memory  on  the 
Behavior   Rating   of   Executive   Function   (BRIEF):   the   MET/Val   genotype   predicted   better 
performance than Val/Val or Met/Met genotype.(Conklin, Meton et al. 2010) 
In medulloblastoma patients, polymorphisms in glutathioneS-transferases (GSTs), which catalyze the 
glutathione  conjugation  of  alkylating  agents,  platinum  compounds  and  free  radicals  formed  by 
radiation, may be another important genetic determinant of neuro-cognitive outcome: compared with 
all others, patients with at least one null genotype had on average 27.2 (p=0.0002) lower full-scale 
intelligence quotient scores.(Barahmani, Carpentieri et al. 2009) GSTM1 polymorphism indicating 
lower  free  radical  scavenging  enzyme  function  were  also  associated  with  higher  anxiety,  more 
depression and more global distress in medulloblastoma survivors.(Brackett, Krull et al. 2010) 
It is very likely that further genetic polymorphisms explaining variation in neuro-cognitive outcome 
in   medulloblastoma   survivors   will   be   identified,   including   some   with   implications   for   a 
pharmacogenomics approach. This may have a clear impact in determining optimal therapeutic doses, 
tailored to the patient’s genotype, and minimizing unwanted effects. Therefore it is planned, to collect 
within  an  associated  study  patient  DNA  for  evaluation  of  the  genetic  polymorphisms,  for  better 
understanding of the role of gene-treatment interactions in determining neuro-cognitive outcome in 
medulloblastoma survivors  
 
Endocrinology: 
Between 60 and 95% of children with brain tumours experience growth hormone insufficiency within 
2-5 years of fractionated (1.8Gy) neuraxial radiation and tumour boost delivering estimated pituitary 
doses in excess of 40Gy (Livesey, Hindmarsh et al. 1990; Schmiegelow, Lassen et al. 2000), but this 
is usually the only pituitary deficit if the tumour is in the posterior fossa - distant from the central 
hypothalamo-pituitary   axis   (HPA).(Spoudeas,   Charmandari   et   al.   2003) Growth   hormone 
insufficiency is  evident  as early  growth  failure  or  arrest  with  disturbed  growth  hormone  secretion 
even in children with posterior fossa tumours assessed prospectively from diagnosis to 2 years post 
radiation  with  a  potentiating  effect  of  additional  chemotherapy.(Spoudeas,  Hindmarsh et  al.  1996) 
Scattered skeletal irradiation from the exit dose of the spinal beam predisposes to vertebral damage and 
further statural shortening (Olshan, Gubernick et al. 1992) and a range of thyroid (Ogilvy-Stuart, Shalet 
et   al.   1991) and   gonadal (Livesey   and   Brook   1988) dysfunction   over   time,   including   early 
puberty.(Ogilvy-Stuart, Clayton et al. 1994) These effects seem potentiated by adjuvant chemotherapy 
after older treatment protocols and are known to be treatment, dose- , time- and (in the case of the gonad) 
sex-dependent, but their evolution has not been previously studied prospectively in the context of a large 
brain  tumour  trial.  They  are  significant  ranging  from  asymptomatic  compensated  hypothyroidism  or 
hypogonadism - manifest   early   only   as   simple   TSH  or   FSH   elevation,   progressing  to   frank 
hypothyroidism and second thyroid cancers if the TSH is not appropriately and timely suppressed by 
substitutive therapy(Bhatia, Yasui et al. 2003), and infertility (in males), or delayed puberty, pubertal 
arrest or future premature menopause in girls.(Gurney, Kadan-Lottick et al. 2003) Long term infertility 
is a major cause of distress, affecting 15 to 30% of all childhood cancer survivors but especially post 
adolescent  males  and  adult females  receiving  high  cumulative  doses  of  alkylating  agents  such  as  the 
nitrosoureas (CCNU) and cyclophosphamide used in this treatment protocol.(Thomson, Critchley et al. 
2002) With high survival rates from cancer, and increasing possibilities for assisted fertilization and pre-
treatment fertility preservation (Lee, Schover et al. 2006) it is increasingly important to fully understand 
the  likely  evolution  of  gonadotoxicity  after  each  treatment  protocol  especially  in  those  treated 
prepubertally for whom there is little age-appropriate data and for whom preservation treatment options 
may be unavailable or unethical.(von Wolff, Donnez et al. 2009)  

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17

Hormone  status  has  important  effects  on  health-related  well-being,  bone  and  muscle  mass,  QoL, 
cognition, and second tumour prevention. This is exemplified by the need for adult growth hormone 
replacement (Carroll, Christ et al. 1998), recognised benefits of sex steroids in maintaining bone and 
uterine  health,  pubertal  progress,  sexuality  and  reproductive  function(Critchley,  Bath  et  al.  2002), 
and the importance of thyroxine therapy to treat frank or compensated hypothyroidism, in the latter 
case to suppress tumorigenesis.(Schmiegelow, Feldt-Rasmussen et al. 2003) All also have important 
effects on emotional and cognitive state and should be replaced in a timely fashion. 
 
To screen for potential infertility / gonadal dysfunction it is possible to assess elevations in the plasma 
gonadotropin FSH: levels above 15 IU/l are well outside the normative range for both sexes at all age 
ranges, particularly high for adult women in the follicular phase (D2-6) of a spontaneous cycle and, 
compared to other biomarkers, likely to indicate subfertility.(Stewart and Turner 2005) Even in early 
infancy there are sex steroids which suppress gonadotropins, so that agonadal patients such as those 
with   Turner   syndrome,   exhibit   high   (castrate)   amplitude   serum   gonadotropins   with   normal 
pulsatility.(Conte, Grumbach et al. 1980; Nathwani, Hindmarsh et al. 1998) These, restrained by the 
CNS, reach a nadir in midchildhood (7 years of age) before rising again towards puberty.(Bridges, 
Matthews et al. 1994) This CNS restraint may be disrupted in children with brain tumours, tending 
to an early puberty.  It is thus possible with serum FSH levels to screen for dysfunction of gonadal 
axes  even  in  the  young  prepubertal  child.  This  will  not  only  ensure  the  appropriate  and  timely 
hormone replacement required for mental and emotional wellbeing but  also assess  any differential 
toxicity between two different intensity treatment regimens  
To   assess   dysfunction   of   other   hormone   axes,   regular   endocrinological   follow-up   is 
recommended  (see chapter 12.3.  Post-treatment  Follow-up,  page 92)  and  any  hormone 
replacement needs to be documented within PNET 5 MB. 
 
Neurology 
Patients  with  medulloblastoma  are  at  risk  for  neurologic  morbidity,  which  in  some  cases  persists 
lifelong.    A    relation    between    neurological    and    neuropsychological    outcome    has    been 
suggested.(Puget, Boddaert et al. 2009)  
Comprehensive surveys of neurological function are time consuming to document, and meaningful 
analyses  are  only  possible  based  on  focussed  and  standardised  evaluations.  Therefore,  although 
comprehensive clinical neurological examinations are necessary for the clinical care of every patient, 
documentation will be limited to tumour location specific items. 
Documentation of postoperative neurological functions will focus on posterior fossa syndrome (see 
chapter 4.4.1.  Neurosurgery,  page 39).  A  previously  published  scale (Robertson,  Muraszko  et  al. 
2006) will be used for grading.  
Within  follow-up  focus of  neurologic  documentation  will  be  on  cerebellar  dysfunction.  As  a  short 
and  easy  to  perform  scale,  the  brief  ataxia  rating  scale  will  be  used.(Schmahmann,  Gardner  et  al. 
2009) It  depicts  localisation  specific  ataxia  (inclusive  oculomotor  abnormalities)  with  a  standard 
grading.  However,  as  cerebellar  function  has  not  completely  developed  within  young  ages,  it  is 
necessary to consider age appropriate normal values. These are not yet available currently, but it is 
planned to evaluate them in parallel, so that they will be available for analysis at the end of the PNET 
5 MB study.

5A. AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF PNET 5 MB - LR  
 
5A.1. Aim  
The aim of the study is to confirm the high rate of event-free survival in patients between the ages of 
3 to 5 years and less than 16.0 years, with ‘standard risk’ medulloblastoma with a low-risk biological 
profile.  Patients  eligible  for  the  study  will  be those  with  non-metastatic medulloblastoma  (by  CSF 
cytology and centrally reviewed MRI imaging) at diagnosis and low-risk biological profile, defined 
as (i)  WNT  subgroup  positivity,  assessed  by -catenin  IHC  (mandatory), -catenin  mutation 
(mandatory) and monosomy 6 (optional) testing, and (ii) an absence of high-risk biological features 
(MYC or MYCN amplification). Patients will have undergone total or near-total tumour resection and 
will  receive  conventionally  fractionated  (once  a  day)  radiotherapy  with  a dose  of  54.0 Gy  to  the 
primary tumour and 18.0 Gy to the craniospinal axis. Following radiotherapy, patients will receive a 
reduced-intensity chemotherapy with a total of 6 cycles of chemotherapy consisting of 3 courses of 
cisplatin, CCNU and vincristine alternating with 3 courses of cyclophosphamide and vincristine. 
 
5A.2. Objectives 
5A.2.1. Primary Objective of PNET 5 MB - LR 
The primary objective of the study is to confirm that the rate of 3-year Event-Free Survival (EFS) in 
children  and  adolescents  with standard-risk  medulloblastoma  having  a  low-risk  biological  profile 
remains in excess of 80% when patients are treated with 18.0 Gy neuraxis irradiation plus boost to 
the primary tumour, and reduced-intensity chemotherapy. 
 
5A.2.2. Secondary Objectives of PNET 5 MB - LR 
The secondary objectives are: 
 
a)   To  investigate  the  Overall  Survival  (OS)  rate,  progression  free  survival  (PFS), and  pattern  of 
relapse in this patient group. 
 
b) To  study  the  late  effects  of  the  reduced-dose  approach,  focusing  on  hearing,  endocrine,  and 
neurologic  function,  and  standardized,  patients/  parents  rated  measurments  of  health  status, 
executive function, behavioural outcome, and quality of life.  
 
c) To  conduct  comprehensive  studies  in  a  prospective  fashion  on  the  biological  basis  of  WNT-
subgroup  medulloblastoma,  with  the  aim  of  identification,  investigation  and  validation  of 
biomarkers  and  drug  targets  with  therapeutic  potential  in  this  disease  subgroup.  These 
investigations will focus on (i). detailed analysis  of biological pathways  and molecular events 
established to play a role in medulloblastoma, or that are of potential prognostic significance in 
this  disease  group,  (ii).  comprehensive  genome-wide  investigations  of  novel  medulloblastoma 
defects, and (iii). defining diagnostic correlates of WNT pathway activation. . 
 
5A.3 Outcome Measures  
5A.3.1. Primary Outcome Measure in PNET 5 MB - LR 
The primary outcome measure is the rate of event-free survival (EFS). 
 
An “event” is considered to be any progression or relapse of disease, any deaths, and any occurrence 
of a secondary neoplasm. 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
52 
“Relapse” is defined as the appearance of local disease, metastasis, or both following documented 
complete resection, or previous complete response. “Progression” is defined as tumour growth > 25% 
(based on the three-dimensional measurement on the MRI) in the case of residual tumour. “Secondary 
neoplasm” is defined as any diagnosed neoplasm that was distinct from medulloblastoma. 
The  percentage  of  patients  in  whom  no  event  has  occurred  at  36  months  of follow-up  will  be  the 
measure for EFS. 
 
5A.3.2. Secondary Outcome Measures in PNET 5 MB – LR 
The rate of overall survival (OS), and progression free survival (PFS), estimated by the Kaplan-Meier 
method, are secondary outcome measures. 
 
Pattern of relapse is a secondary outcome measure. The site and time to local progression will be the 
measures for local tumour control. Particular attention will be  given to posterior fossa relapse, i.e. 
relapse within or outside the tumour bed. The time period begins on the date of surgery and ends on 
the date of appearance of relapse/progression.The appearance of metastases will not be regarded as 
local progression. 
 
Indirect  measures  of  quality  of  survival  (QoS)  are  a  secondary  outcome  measure.  Standardized, 
patients/ parents rated scales for measurement of health status (HUI3), executive function (BRIEF), 
behavioural outcome (SDQ), medical, educational, employment and social situation (MEES), Fatigue 
(PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale and, in adults, the MFI), and quality of life (PedsQL and, 
in adults, the QLQ-C30) will be the indirect measures for QoS.  
 
Audiological  toxicity  is  a  secondary  outcome  measure.  The  extent  of  ototoxicity  based  dose 
modifications of maintenance chemotherapy, as well as the results of Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA) 
graded by the Chang criteria (see chapter 9.4.2. Audiology, page 72) evaluated 2 years after diagnosis 
will be the measures for audiological toxicity. 
 
Endocrine function is a secondary outcome measure. FSH levels (cut-off level >15 IU/l) will be used 
as biomarker for subfertility. Growth retardation will be calculated as the difference in height standard 
deviation  score  (sds)  from  diagnosis,  and  the  need  for,  time  to,  and  duration  of  hormone 
supplementation  will  be  used  as  surrogate  markers  for  endocrine  deficits.  All  measures  will  be 
evaluated 2 and 5 years from diagnosis/surgery and again in adulthood at 18 years. 
 
Neurological  function  is  an  outcome  measure.  The  occurrence  and  severity  of  posterior  fossa 
syndrome  (as  measured  by  the  cerebellar  mutism  syndrome  survey,  Robertson  et  al.  Journal  of 
Neurosurgery 2006(Robertson, Muraszko et al. 2006)), and the occurrence and severity of persisting 
cerebellar symptoms (measured by the brief ataxia rating scale (Schmahmann, Gardner et al. 2009)) 
will be the measures for neurological function.  
 
The  prognostic  value  of  biological  tumour  markers  is  an  outcome  measure.  Results  of  protein 
expression   (including   immunohistochemistry),   RNA   expression,   and   DNA   analysis   assays 
undertaken on tumour, blood or CSF material will be the measures for biological properties.

5B. Aim and Objectives of PNET 5 MB - SR 
 
5B.1. Aim  
The  aim  of  the  study  is  to  test  whether  concurrent  carboplatin  during  radiotherapy  followed  by  8 
cycles  of  maintenance  chemotherapy  in  patients  with  ‘standard  risk’  medulloblastoma  with  an 
average-risk  biological  profile  may  improve  outcome.  Patients  eligible  for  the  study  will  be  those 
with  non-metastatic  medulloblastoma  (by  CSF  cytology  and  centrally  reviewed  MRI  imaging)  at 
diagnosis and average-risk biological profile, defined as (i) WNT subgroup negativity, assessed by 
-catenin IHC (mandatory), -catenin mutation (mandatory) and monosomy 6 (optional) testing, or 
(ii) WNT subgroup positivity in patients aged ≥16.0 years at diagnosis, and (iii) an absence of high-
risk biological features (MYC or MYCN amplification). Patients will have undergone total or near-
total tumour resection and will receive conventionally fractionated (once a day) radiotherapy with a 
dose of 54.0 Gy to the primary tumour and 23.4 Gy to the craniospinal axis. Following radiotherapy, 
patients  will  receive a  modified-intensity  chemotherapy  with a  total  of  8  cycles  of  chemotherapy 
consisting   of   4   courses   of   cisplatin,   CCNU   and   vincristine   alternating   with   4   courses   of 
cyclophosphamide and vincristine. 
 
5B.2. Objectives  
5B.2.1. Primary Objective of PNET 5 MB - SR 
The primary objective of the study is to assess whether the concurrent administration of carboplatin 
during radiotherapy has an effect on the Event-Free Survival (EFS) in children and adolescents with 
standard-risk medulloblastoma having an average-risk biological profile.  
 
5B.2.2. Secondary Objectives of PNET 5 MB - SR 
The secondary objectives are: 
 
a)   To investigate the Overall Survival rates (OS), the Progession-free survival rates (PFS), and the 
pattern of relapse in the randomized treatment arms. 
 
b) To test the feasibility of carboplatin treatment concomitantly to radiotherapy 
 
c) To study the late effects in the randomized treatment arms, focusing on hearing, endocrine, and 
neurologic  function,  and  standardized,  patients/  parents  rated  measurments of  health  status, 
executive function, behavioural outcome, and quality of life.  
 
d) To conduct comprehensive studies in a prospective fashion on the biological basis of standard-
risk medulloblastoma, with the aim of identification, investigation and validation of biomarkers 
(diagnostic, prognostic and predictive) and drug targets with therapeutic potential in this disease 
subgroup.  These  investigations  will  focus  on  (i).  detailed  analysis  of  biological  pathways  and 
molecular events established to play a role in medulloblastoma, or that have been shown to have 
potential prognostic significance in this disease subgroup (e.g. chromosome 17 abnormalities), 
and (ii). comprehensive genome-wide investigations of novel medulloblastoma defects.

5B.3 Outcome Measures  
5B.3.1. Primary Outcome Measure in PNET 5 MB - SR 
The primary outcome measure is event-free survival (EFS). 
 
An “event” is considered to be any progression or relapse of disease, any deaths, and any occurrence 
of a secondary neoplasm.  
“Relapse” is defined as the appearance of local disease, metastasis, or both following documented 
complete resection, or previous complete response. “Progression” is defined as tumour growth > 25% 
(based on the three-dimensional measurement on the MRI) in the case of residual tumour. “Secondary 
neoplasm” is defined as any diagnosed neoplasm that was distinct from medulloblastoma. 
EFS will be calculated by the Kaplan-Meier Method. 
 
5B.3.2. Secondary Outcome Measures in PNET 5 MB - SR 
The  rate  of  overall  survival  (OS),  and the  rate  of  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  are  secondary 
outcome measures. OS and PFS will be calculated by the Kaplan-Meier Method. 
 
Pattern of relapse is a secondary outcome measure. The site and time to local progression will be the 
measures for local tumour control. Particular attention will be  given to posterior fossa relapse, i.e. 
local relapse within the tumour bed, or metastatic relapse to the posterior fossa outside the tumour 
bed.  The  time  period  begins  on  the  date  of  surgery  and  ends  on  the  date of  appearance  of 
relapse/progression.The appearance of metastases will not be regarded as local progression. 
 
Feasibility of carboplatin treatment concomitantly to radiotherapy is a secondary outcome measure. 
The timely delivery of maintenance chemotherapy, the number of interruption days, and the grade of 
weight  change,  dysphagia  and  esophagitis, transfusion  requirement, haematological toxicities,  and 
infection during therapy,  as  well  as  ototoxicity are  measures of the  feasibility  of  additional 
carboplatin. 
 
Indirect  measures  of  quality  of  survival  (QoS)  are  a  secondary  outcome  measure.  Standardized, 
patients/ parents rated scales for measurement of health status (HUI3), executive function (BRIEF), 
behavioural outcome (SDQ), medical, educational, employment and social situation (MEES), Fatigue 
(PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale and, in adults, the MFI), and quality of life (PedsQL and, 
in adults, the QLQ-C30) will be the indirect measures for QoS.  
 
Audiological  toxicity  is  a  secondary  outcome  measure.  The  extent  of  ototoxicity  based  dose 
modifications of maintenance chemotherapy, as well as the results of Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA) 
graded by the Chang criteria (see chapter 9.4.2. Audiology, page 72) evaluated 2 years after diagnosis 
will be the measures for audiological toxicity.

as biomarker for subfertility. Growth retardation will be calculated as the difference in height standard 
deviation  score  (sds)  from  diagnosis,  and  the  need  for,  time  to,  and  duration  of  hormone 
supplementation  will  be  used  as  surrogate  markers  for  endocrine  deficits.  All  measures  will  be 
evaluated 2 and 5 years from diagnosis/surgery and again in adulthood at 18 years.  
 
Neurological  function  is  an  outcome  measure.  The  occurrence  and  severity  of  posterior  fossa 
syndrome  (as  measured  by  the  cerebellar  mutism  syndrome  survey,  Robertson  et  al.  Journal  of 
Neurosurgery 2006(Robertson, Muraszko et al. 2006)), and the occurrence and severity of persisting

55 
cerebellar symptoms (measured by the brief ataxia rating scale (Schmahmann, Gardner et al. 2009)) 
will be the measures for neurological function.  
 
The  prognostic  value  of  biological  tumour  markers  is  an  outcome  measure.  Results  of  protein 
expression   (including   immunohistochemistry),   RNA   expression,   and   DNA   analysis   assays 
undertaken on tumour, blood or CSF material will be the measures for biological properties.

8. Screening Investigations and Consent  
 
8.1. Screening investigations  
(see also chapter14.2. Registration of Patients and Patient Identification, page 101) 
 
Patients eligible for the study will be those with non-metastatic medulloblastoma, confirmed by CSF 
cytology  and  centrally  reviewed  MRI  imaging  at  diagnosis.  Patients  will  have  undergone  total  or 
near-total resection of the tumour. 
 
8.1.1. Pre-operative Period 
The following assessments are to be performed in the pre-operative period: 
 
a) Physical examination with full neurological examination. 
 
b) Whole brain MRI imaging pre- and post-contrast.  
 
c) MRI  of  the  spine  with  complete visualisation  of  the  dural  sac  (can  also  be  performed  early 
postoperatively). 
 
Central review of preoperative MRI imaging is mandatory. 
Please  see  the  respective  chapter  on  imaging  recommendations (see 9.2.  Recommendations  for 
imaging and central MRI review, page 62) 
 
If there is no evidence for metastases in the centrally review of cranial and spinal MRI the patient 
may be included in the study (see inclusion criterion c). 
 
8.1.2. Post-operative Period 
The following assessments are to be performed in the post-operative period: 
 
a) Cerebral MRI pre- and post-contrast injection. 
 
To be performed within 72 h, preferentially on day 1 or 2 after surgery but not on the day of surgery 
(= day 0) 
 
The size of any post-operative residual tumour will be recorded. 
 
Central review of post-operative MRI imaging is mandatory. 
Please regard the respective chapter on imaging recommendations (see 9.2. Recommendations for 
imaging and central MRI review, page 62) 
 
If there is a centrally confirmed gross total resection, or residual tumour is less than or equal to 1.5 
cm
2
 (area in the axial plane), the patient may be included in the study (see. inclusion criterion c). 
In  patients  with  significant  residual tumour (>  1.5  cm
2
)  after  first  surgery,  secondary  surgery 
should be considered. Patients with a reduction of postoperative residual tumour through second 
surgery to less than or equal to 1.5 cm
2
 are eligible, if second surgery is performed within 14 days 
after first surgery. 
 
b) MRI  of  the  craniospinal  axis  with  complete  visualisation  of  the  dural  sac  (if  not  performed 
preoperatively). 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
59 
 
c) Lumbar puncture for CSF cytology:  
Lumbar  puncture  showing  a  CSF  free  of tumour cells  is  mandatory  before  randomisation.  It  is 
allowed (and recommended for keeping time lines for stratification and to start radiotherapy, if the 
clinical  situation  allows lumbar  puncture) to  perform  lumbar  puncture within  the  first  2  weeks 
after surgery. If a lumbar puncture is performed within 14 days after last surgery and is negative 
for  tumour  cells, then  this  will  be  taken  as  evidence  of  non-metastatic  disease.  If,  however,  the 
CSF is positive for tumour cells on lumbar puncture taken within 14 days after last surgery, the 
lumbar puncture must be repeated at day 15 or later.  
In   case   of   equivocal   CSF cytology,   performance   of   a   second   lumbar   puncture   is   also 
recommended. 
Involvement of CSF pathways by tumour is defined as the unequivocal identification of primitive 
neuro-ectodermal  cells,  either  on  cytological  grounds  or  with  a  combination  of cytological  and 
immunocytochemical  features  (e.g.  reactivity  for  GFAP  or  a  neuronal  marker,  such  as  NSE  or 
synaptophysin). According to national regulations a CSF review might be required. 
If the cytospin of lumbar CSF is negative for tumour cells, the patient may be included in the study 
(see Inclusion Criterion c). 
 
d) Histopathological diagnosis of classic or desmoplastic medulloblastoma in accordance with WHO 
classification (2007), comfirmed by central reference histology. 
 
e) WNT subgroup status (by -catenin IHC: immunoreactivity +/- (mandatory), -catenin mutation 
analysis: +/- (mandatory) and monosomy 6 status (optional)) and MYC and MYCN amplification 
status (mandatory).

Informed  consent  for  therapy  and  for  data  handling  will  be  obtained  in  accordance  with  national 
requirements. For children and adolescents who are too young to give informed consent, depending 
on national definitions, informed consent will be obtained in written form from the parents. Patient 
assent may also be obtained, depending on national requirements. 
 
It  is  recommended  to  obtain  a  separate  consent  for  the  submission of tumour material,  MRI,  and 
patient data at the time when the pathological diagnosis of medulloblastoma has been made locally, 
as these need to be sent to the respective reference centres before eligibility for PNET 5 MB - LR and 
PNET 5 MB - SR can be checked.  
 
Written  informed  consent  should  also  be  obtained for  the  biological  studies,  in  accordance  with 
national  guidelines.  These  should  include  consent  for  the  link-anonymised  investigation  of  all 
biological materials collected (i.e. tumour biopsy, CSF, blood), including germline DNA. 
 
Consent Forms have to be adapted to the national requirements by each participating national group.

9.2. Recommendations for imaging and central MRI review 
Evaluation  of  the  primary  tumour,  the  size  of  a  residual  tumour  after  resection  and  its  possible 
dissemination within the CSF are crucial for the identification of patients eligible to the PNET 5 MB 
- LR and PNET 5 MB - SR studies. Therefore the minimum requirements for the imaging in study 
patients  must  be  adhered  to.  The  most  important  issue  is  comparability  of  MRIs  pre- and 
postoperatively and during follow up. So, if the baseline MRI did not follow these requirements either 
repeat  the  imaging  preoperatively  or  perform  the  postoperative  imaging  in  a  way  (e.g.  additional 
sequences  to  your  standard  protocol)  that  sequences  comparable  with  the  preoperative  MRI  are 
available. This is especially important in medulloblastomas which show little or no enhancement. In 
these cases the T2, PD, FLAIR and precontrast T1 images must be comparable.  
In case of very small either primary, residual or recurrent tumour the exact measurement of such a 
small  structure  will  necessitate  smaller  slice  lengths  than  usual.  In  plane  resolution  is  an  essential 
factor of image quality and therefore a 256 (or 512) matrix for the imaging of the brain and a 512 
resolution for spinal canal is necessary. The FOV should be restricted to about 230 mm for the brain 
and max. 350 mm for the spinal MRI.  
The  tumour  and  possible  postoperative  residue  should  be  measurable  in  the  3  planes  for  the 
calculation of tumour volume (a x b x c/2). D-volume calculations may be performed additionally. 
Every effort should be put to reach in the highest accuracy achievable. 
Please discuss this protocol with your local (neuro-) radiologist to avoid problems during the study. 
For discussion do not hesitate to contact the national representative for the central imaging review.  
   
Cranial MRI: 
The standard imaging plane for the brain should be the axial plane (aligned to the AC-PC axis). Slice 
thickness should not exceed 4mm and must be adapted to the individual problem. As the signal of a 
tumour  depends  on  the  field  strength  of  the  MRI  machine  the  field  strength  must  not  be  changed 
during the study.  
 
For 1-1.5 Tesla MR-machines: 
Sequences: 
Axial T2 and PD or FLAIR  
Coronal FLAIR 
Axial T1 -/+ contrast 
Coronal and sagittal T1 (-)/+ contrast 
Axial DWI with ADC (3 directions ; b-value = 1000) 
 
Optional but not replacing the standard given above: 3D gradient echo T1 + contrast and functional 
imaging (e.g. perfusion, MRS, DTI and any other individual local imaging protocols). 
 
For 3 T-MRIs the T1 imaging usually will be performed as 3D-gradient echo sequence without and 
with contrast. If possible (depending on the individual scanner) additional to the 3D volume sequence 
T1-SE, T1-gradient echo or T1-IR sequences (e.g. in the axial plane) should be acquired. Please don’t 
change your selection during follow-up. 
 
Spinal MRI: 
Avoid 3T MRI for spinal imaging as the image quality is often inferior to that of 1.5T MR-machines 
and more unpredictable. The dural sac has to be fully visualized. 
 
As  only  meningeal  disease  is  of  interest  only  sagittal  postcontrast  T1-weighted  sequences  are 
necessary. Sagittal slice thickness must not exceed 3 mm. The physiological veins of the cord can be 
mistaken  for  nodules  of  dissemination  and  therefore  axial  slices  without  gaps  (SL  can  be  chosen 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
63 
individually) are essential for all suspicious areas. As fat suppression often leads to artefacts and is 
not necessary for the delineation of meningeal disease it should not be used routinely. 
Optional: 
T2 TSE sequences or fat suppression techniques. They can be added easily after the T1 postcontrast 
series if necessary.  
 
Early postoperative imaging: 
As  non-specific  intracranial  enhancement  is   often  seen  after  3  days  following  surgery   the 
postoperative MRI must be obtained within this time.  
It is strongly recommended to perform post operative MRI scans within 72 h, preferentially on 
day 1 or 2 after surgery but not on the day of surgery (= day 0) 
Even  within  this  time, false  positive nodular  enhancement  can  be  seen  with  haemostatic  materials 
and after electrocoagulation and therefore not only the T1-weighted images before and after contrast 
need  to  be  evaluated  but  also  the  signal  intensities  on  the  T2-weighted  and  FLAIR  series. 
Comparability with the preoperative MRI is essential for the detection of residual tumour. The size 
of a possible residue has to be measured in three planes. If the residue is best visible on T2-weighted 
images a second plane incorporating a T2-weighted sequence must be employed. 
A residue is considered to be any area of pathological signal and/or enhancement comparable with 
the appearance of the preoperative tumour. 
For the evaluation of residual tumour on imaging the surgical report is often valuable and should be 
available. 
 
Sequences for cranial and spinal imaging see prescriptions for cranial and spinal MRI (page 62).  
Please note if spinal MRI is performed postoperatively: 
Non-specific subdural enhancement may be identified on postoperative imaging of the spine and must 
not be mistaken for meningeal dissemination. In any case of doubt or if intense subdural enhancement 
is seen repeat the spinal MRI after about 2 weeks to clarify the situation. 
 
Follow-up MRIs: 
Timing for follow-up MRIs should be planned according to the protocol (see Chapter 12. Summary 
of Follow-up, page 92). 
 
Measurement of tumour size: 
Multiply the largest diameters in the three planes according to the formula (a x b x c)/2. Additionally 
volume calculations of a 3D-dataset can be calculated if available for comparison. If the tumour takes 
up contrast completely then the postcontrast T1 can be used for the measurement of the diameters. 
But in only partly or non-enhancing tumours also the size on T2/FLAIR or PD and T1 without contrast 
can be relevant and the best sequence cannot be predicted. For follow-up it is useful to choose the 
same sequence or if you would have to change the sequence e.g. due to a change in contrast behaviour 
than measure the tumour sizes in the same sequence also on the previous examination for comparison. 
 
Definitions of residual tumour: 
As very subtle residual tumours may not be visible on imaging it is encouraged to compare the results 
of imaging with the neurosurgical report. A thin line of enhancement can be physiological on early 
postoperative MRI in the absence of a residual tumour and must not be considered tumour. 
 
The residual tumour will be defined as follows (applies only for early postoperative MRI): 
 
Due to historical reasons, for medulloblastomas the postoperative classification system according to 
Chang  will  be  used.  Previous  studies  found  a  worse  prognosis  for  residual  tumours  after  resection 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
64 
larger than 1.5 cm
2
 in area (in the axial plane to achieve the comparison to imaging in studies during 
the preceding CT era). 
 
SO: no residual tumour. 
S1: residual tumour below or equal to 1.5 cm
2
. 
S2: residual tumour larger than 1.5 cm
2
. 
S3: residual tumour infiltration the brain stem irrespective of size.   
S4: residual tumour leaving the posterior cranial cavity. 
If imaging is inadequate or the surgical cavity is very confusing also the term “unclear” will be used. 
Sometimes  the  presence  of  blood  can  be  ruled  out  and  distinguished  from tumour if  the  MRI  is 
repeated after some days. 
 
Definitions for neuroradiological response evaluation: 
The staging of a possible residual tumour follows the guidelines of the PNET 4 study: 
 
CR (complete response): no evidence of residual or recurrent tumour or meningeal dissemination. 
PR  (partial  response): Reduction  of  tumour  volume  equal  or  more  than  50%  compared  to  the 
previous staging MRI.  
IMP (improvement or minor response): Reduction of tumour volume between 50% and equal or 
more than 25% (and minor reduction of a meningeal dissemination). 
SD  (stable  disease): Tumour  volume  between  +25%  and -25%  compared  to  the  previous  staging 
MRI (no real change of a meningeal dissemination). 
PD (progressive disease): increase of tumour volume of equal or more than 25% or new lesion. 
 
Evaluation of leukencephalopathy:  
Two years after diagnosis a MRI should be sent for central evaluation of leucencephalopathy. 
Grading of leukencephalopathy will be based on T2 or FLAIR images as follows (Fazekas, Chawluk 
et al. 1987): 
 
Grade 0: no pathology 
Grade 1: punctated or small T2-hyperintensities max up to 25% of the frontoparietal white matter 
Grade 2: confluant T2-hyperintensities in between 25 and max 50% of the area of the frontoparietal 
white matter 
Grade 3: more than 50% of the frontoparietal white matter 
 
Additionally,  the presence  of  white  matter  cysts,  and  white  matter  lesion  enhancement  will  be 
recorded. 
 
Evaluation in case of suspected relapse: 
In case of suspected relapse a MRI should also be sent for central evaluation.

9.3. Biological Investigations  
The overall strategy for biological investigations within the PNET 5 MB - LR and PNET 5 MB - SR 
studies is two-fold; (i) to stratify patients for therapy on the basis of molecular diagnostics undertaken 
using well-defined biological markers, and (ii) to conduct comprehensive  studies on the biological 
basis of medulloblastoma, with the aim of identification, investigation and validation of biomarkers 
and drug targets with therapeutic potential in the disease.  
 
Biological investigations in PNET 5 MB - LR and PNET 5 MB - SR will be undertaken in parallel; 
studies in PNET 5 MB - LR will focus on investigation of favourable-risk WNT-subgroup cases, aged 
<16.0 years  at  diagnosis, while PNET  5  MB - SR will  investigate  the  remaining  WNT-negative 
standard-risk cases. Together, these combined data will provide a comprehensive investigation of the 
biological basis of non-high-risk medulloblastoma in patients aged 3 to 5 years and less than 22 years at 
diagnosis. 
Note: Timely results (within 22 days of surgery) of histopathology, MYC and MYCN amplification, 
and WNT subgroup status (ß-catenin immunohistochemistry, ß-catenin mutation and monosomy  6 
(monosomy 6 testing is optional)) are nessessary for inclusion of the patient into the PNET 5 MB - 
LR and PNET 5 MB - SR studies.  
 
A  series  of  significant  logistical  challenges  exist  to  the  routine  assessment  of  biomarkers  and 
histopathological indices as a basis for therapeutic stratification in MB. Foremost, the collection of 
fresh-frozen tumour material is essential for the robust assessment of the majority of established MB 
biomarkers. Patients with medulloblastoma across Europe are treated across a large number of centres 
in different countries, and the success of these studies will depend on the instigation of standardised 
systems for the collection, storage and shipping of frozen and formalin-fixed tumour material from 
multiple centres, followed by its centralised molecular genetic analysis and histo-pathological review, 
prior  to  the  commencement  of  adjuvant  therapy.  This  must  take  place  within  a  22  days  following 
initial  surgical  resection  of  the  tumour,  to  allow  the  stratification  of  adjuvant  chemotherapy  and 
radiotherapy   received,   based   on   the   results   obtained.   The   additional   challenge   exists   of 
standardisation of approach and  results between  countries, and the requirement to work within the 
research  ethics  and  governance  frameworks  mandated  by  law  within  each  participating  country 
(reviewed in Pizer & Clifford, 2009). 
 
9.3.1. The SIOP PNET Biology Group 
A biology committee has been established within the SIOP-E PNET group to undertake, coordinate 
and  quality  control  molecular  diagnostics,  central  pathology  review,  and  translational  biological 
studies within SIOP-E PNET clinical trials. The committee has biology / pathology representatives 
from  all  countries. One  central  coordinating  centre  has  been  designated  for  each  country. The 
representatives of each national group are named within the “Contacts” section (see Appendix B.2. 
National Reference centres and Coordinators for Biology and Pathology). 
 
9.3.2. Collection and Storage of Biological Material 
The  collection  and  storage  of  high-quality  biological  material  from  study  cases  is  essential  for  the 
conduction of the molecular diagnostics and biological research components of the PNET 5 MB - LR 
and PNET  5  MB - SR trials.  All  tissue collection,  preparation  and  storage  must  be  undertaken 
according to the standard operating procedures (SOPs) defined within this protocol (see Appendix D-
Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). 
 
A. Submission   of   the   following   materials,   immediately   following   a diagnosis   of 
medulloblastoma at the treating centre, is required for molecular diagnostic assessments 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
66 
and  is  mandatory  for  study  entry. Materials  should  be  submitted  to  the  National 
coordinating centre as described in the attached standard operating procedure (see Appendix 
D1 sample preparation, central pathology review and molecular diagnostics. 
 
Snap-frozen tumour material 
To be used for ‘touch imprint’ preparation (for FISH investigations, including the assessment 
of MYC and MYCN gene amplification and monosomy 6 status), extraction of nucleic acids 
(for DNA/RNA extraction, -catenin (CTNNB1) mutation analysis and research studies) and 
proteins. 
 
Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tumour material 
To be used for histopathology review, -catenin status assessment by IHC, and preparation of 
materials (e.g. tissue microarray and unstained sections) for research studies (e.g. FISH and 
IHC investigations). 
 
B. To  allow  further  prospective  biologic  research evaluation  (see chapter 5A. Aim and 
Objectives of PNET 5 MB - LR, page 51, and chapter 5B. Aim and Objectives of PNET 5 
MB - SR,  page 53), collection  and submission  of  the  following  materials  to  the  national 
biology  and  pathology  coordinating  centre,  using  procedures  described  in  the  attached 
standard  operating  procedures  (see  Appendix D1  Sample preparation,  central  pathology 
review and molecular diagnostics by National Refrence Laboratories) is also required.   
 
Blood samples  
Whole blood (for DNA extraction) & serum samples should be submitted. 
 
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample  
A 14- or 15-day post-surgical lumbar CSF sample should be submitted. 
 
C. In  addition,  in  relapsing  patients,  second  biopsy  status  should  be  monitored  and,  where 
available, second biopsy material submitted (as above) for the biological studies. 
 
All research samples and derivatives will be stored at the national biology and pathology coordinating 
centres,  prior  to  their  distribution  to  participating  laboratories,  for  use  in  the  biological  studies 
described in this protocol. 
 
9.3.3. Biological Investigations 1: Molecular Diagnostics, Relevant for Stratification 
The  following  assessments  should  be  undertaken  on  tumour  material  received  at  the  national 
coordinating centre, and results reported within 22 days of initial surgical resection. These results will 
be used as the basis of therapeutic stratification in PNET 5 MB - LR and PNET 5 MB - SR: 
 
A. Histopathological review 
 
 To be undertaken according to WHO (2007) criteria. 
 
B. MYC and MYCN gene amplification (both mandatory) and monosomy 6 (optional) status  
 Assessments will be undertaken on fresh-frozen material. Gene amplification is defined using 
FISH  methods as  where  >5%  of  nuclei  within  the  sample  (of  200  counted)  have  a  strong 
speckled  staining  pattern  (indicative  of  the  formation  of  double-minutes  or  homogenously-
staining regions), and a test probe copy number ≥ 4 times copy number of the reference signal, 
showing  clear evidence  of amplification of MYC or MYCN. MYC and MYCN amplification 
status may also be assessed by array-CGH methods, as described in Appendix D. Monosomy 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
67 
6 is defined as (i) a single signal for the p- and q-arms of chromosome 6 in >50% nuclei within 
the sample (of 200 counted) by FISH methods, or (ii) an array-CGH result consistent with the 
presence of monosomy 6 (see Appendix D).  The number of nuclei counted and the number 
of positive nuclei should be recorded. 
 
Note:  FISH  methods  are  the  standard  option  for  the  assessment  of  MYC  and  MYCN 
amplification status. During the course of the PNET 5 MB trial, alternative methodologies for 
the  detection  of  gene  amplification and  monosomy (e.g.  SNP  arrays, MIP, MLPA)  will  be 
assessed by the SIOP-E PNET Biology group. If validated methods of equivalent sensitivity 
and  specificity  to  FISH  are  developed, these  may  be  introduced  as  a  second  testing  option 
through protocol amendments during the course of the trial (see 9.3.4. Section C (iv)). 
 
C. -catenin protein status (assessed by IHC; mandatory) 
 
 Assessments  will  be  undertaken  on  formalin-fixed  material. The  cut-off  to  determine 
positivity for -catenin is defined as the presence of >10% nuclear positive tumour cells within 
a tissue section. The proportion of positive cells should be recorded. 
 
D. -catenin mutation status (assessed by direct DNA sequence analysis; mandatory)  
Assessments will be undertaken on DNA extracted from snap-frozen material.  Positive results 
are  those  cases  displaying  confirmed  non-synonymous  missense  mutations  in  the  mutation 
cluster region.  The nature of the mutation should be recorded. 
 
All  biological  investigations  should  be  undertaken  using  the  standard  reagents  and  methodologies 
defined in the attached SOPs (see Appendix D-Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)). 
 
9.3.4. Biological Investigations 2:  Additional Prospective Biological Studies 
Scope and Aims 
The collection of fresh-frozen tumour biopsy material, alongside blood and CSF samples, will enable 
the conduct of comprehensive biological studies alongside the PNET 5 MB - LR and PNET 5 MB - 
SR studies. The respective analyses to be performed and time of analyses will be defined and regularly 
updated by the study committee in cooperation with the PNET biology working group, and consensus 
will be fixed in a separate document. 
 
The aims of these studies are to: 
1.  Undertake  a  detailed  characterisation  of  the  established  clinical,  molecular  and  histological 
disease features of medulloblastoma. 
2. Identify, characterise and validate novel molecular disease features, using strategies based on 
unbiased genome-wide investigations of transcriptomic, genomic, epigenomic and proteomic 
alterations.  
 
The integrated biological datasets obtained will then be used to: 
A. Establish the clinical and pathological relevance of molecular disease features identified, and 
any inter-relationships that exist between individual disease features. 
B.  Identify  and/or  validate  independent  prognostic  biomarkers  for  the  improved  prediction  of 
disease course.  
C. Develop models for the optimal prediction of disease risk, using combined clinical, pathological 
and molecular indices.   
D. Prioritise potential therapeutic targets for further investigation and validation. 
  

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17

Plan of Investigation 
Investigations  will  focus  on  (i).  detailed  analysis  of  biological  pathways  and  molecular  events 
established to play a role in medulloblastoma, or that are of potential prognostic significance in the 
disease, and (ii). comprehensive genome-wide investigations of medulloblastoma. 
 
A. Investigation of established medulloblastoma pathways / features 
 
Specific analyses will include: 
 
(a). Activation of the WNT pathway, will be assessed by -catenin IHC and transcriptomic analysis. 
Investigations  will  include  mutational  analysis  of  pathway  components  including CTNNB1 
(encoding -catenin), APC, AXIN1, AXIN2, and the assessment of chromosome 6 status by 
FISH and array-based methodologies.  
(b). Activation of the SHH pathway, will be assessed by methods including transcriptomic analysis 
and  IHC  for  the  expression  of  SHH  pathway  components  and  target  genes,  which  we  have 
previously  identified  to  be  associated  with  pathway  activation.  Additionally, mutational 
analysis  of  pathway  components  including PTCH1,  SMO and SUFU will  be  undertaken, 
alongside   assessment   of   chromosome   9q and   10q status   by   FISH   and   array-based 
methodologies.  
(c). Disruption of the TP53 pathway will be assessed by IHC analysis of TP53 stabilisation using 
the D07 antibody. If indicated, mutational analysis of TP53 exons 4-9 by PCR-based direct 
DNA  sequence  analysis  will  be  performed,  alongside  analysis  of MDM2 amplification  and 
P14ARF deletion  status  by  FISH  and  array-based  methodologies,  to  assess  any  role  as 
determinants of pathway disruption.  
(d).  Established  medulloblastoma  genomic  features  of  potential  prognostic  importance will  be 
assessed by FISH and array-based methodologies. These will include investigation of MYC 
gene family amplification status (as previously described), chromosome 17 status, and loci of 
interest from other studies.  
(e). Additional medulloblastoma biological disease features, including those identified within this 
study, will be investigated using appropriate methodologies (see next section). 
 
B. Comprehensive genome-wide investigations of medulloblastoma 
 
A series of core genome-wide datasets will be established to facilitate the wider investigation of the 
biological basis of medulloblastoma. These will be undertaken in the primary tumour material, CSF 
and blood samples, as appropriate, and will include: 
 
(i). High-density assessment of genomic defects and variations, using SNP array (e.g. Affymetrix 
SNP 6.0 arrays or similar methodologies). 
(ii). Comprehensive  transcriptomic  analysis  of  mRNA  expression  and  splice-variants,  using 
Affymetrix exon arrays or similar methodologies. 
(iii). Assessment of micro-RNA expression patterns. 
(iv). Assessment of genome-wide epigenetic (i.e. DNA methylomic) patterns, using methodologies 
including Illumina Infinium arrays. 
(v). Assessment of the medulloblastoma proteome. 
(vi). Next-generation  DNA and  RNA sequencing  technologies are  expected  to  become  available 
within  the  timescale  of  this  project  and,  where  indicated,  will  be  applied  to  investigate  the 
genomic,  transcriptomic  and  epigenomic  features  of  medulloblastoma,  with  the  aim  of 
identification of gene-specific events in disease development.  
(vii).Additional   candidate   medulloblastoma   defects. Additional   biological   features   and/or 
investigative  technologies  which  are  identified  in  preliminary  studies,  published  in  the 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
69 
literature, or become available over the course of this trial will be considered for investigation 
in the PNET 5 MB - LR and PNET 5 MB - SR cohorts'. 
 
C.  Data analysis:  
 
Molecular  features  identified  in  A  and  B  will  be  assessed  to  determine  their  nature  and  overall 
incidence at diagnosis. These data will then be used for: 
 
(i). Integration and analysis of bioinformatic data. The bioinformatic datasets generated will be 
analysed  and  integrated,  and  used  to  identify  and  characterise  the  nature  of  novel  and 
established   molecular   disease   features   and   sub-groups,   and   their   critical   biological 
determinants.   
(ii). Establishment  of  the  clinical  and  pathological  relevance  of  molecular  disease  features 
identified,   and   any   inter-relationships   that   exist   between   individual  disease   features.  
Molecular  disease  features  will  be  related  to  each  other,  and  to  clinical  and  pathological 
indices, using statistical methods as previously described, including corrections for multiple 
testing.  Emphasis  will  be  placed  on  the  definition  of  MB  molecular  disease  sub-groups, 
focussing on investigation of WNT subgroup cases within the PNET 5 MB - LR cohort.  
(iii). Identification  of  prognostic  biomarkers  for  the  improved  prediction  of  disease  course.  
Univariate and multivariate analyses of overall (OS) and event-free (EFS) will be undertaken 
for disease features identified, as previously described. Clinical, pathological and molecular 
features  that  are  independently  predictive  of  disease  outcome  will  be  used  to  investigate 
combined models for the optimal prediction of disease risk.  
(iv). Validation of genome-wide data and marker optimisation. Molecular disease features which 
demonstrate associations with molecular or clinical disease features, or disease outcome, will 
be prioritised for validation and further characterisation using independent methods including 
IHC, FISH, real-time PCR, direct DNA sequencing and bisulphite sequencing, as appropriate. 
These  validations  will  also  be  used  to  define  optimal  methodologies  and  cut-offs  for  the 
routine  testing  of  biomarkers  identified.    Optimal  methodologies  for  the assessment  of 
established  biomarkers  (e.g.  WNT  activation, MYC amplification)  will  also  be  assessed. 
Particular  emphasis  will  be  placed  on  the  investigation  and  validation  of  alternative 
methodologies for the assessment of MYC and MYCN gene amplification status (e.g. SNP 
arrays,  array-CGH, MIP, MLPA)  which  could  be  applied  in  routine  molecular  diagnostics 
(see section 9.2.3.B). 
(v). Prioritisation of molecular events and potential therapeutic targets for further investigation. 
Based on the data generated, further studies will be undertaken to investigate the functional 
relevance  (e.g. in  vitro / in  vivo modelling)  of  molecular,  pathological  and  clinical  disease 
features  identified  and,  where  relevant,  their  potential  as  therapeutic  targets  for  future 
exploitation. 
 
9.4. Study on quality of survival (QoS) 
9.4.1. Indirect measures for QoS 
In PNET 5 MB - LR and PNET 5 MB - SR patients will be assessed on four occasions (post surgery 
before  RT,  at  two  and  five  years  after  diagnosis and  again  at  age  18  years)  using  several  brief 
questionnaires  (see  Table  below).  For  patients  who  are  18  years  of  age  at  two  or  five  years  after 
diagnosis, the coincidence of these time points will mean that only three assessments are required. 
These  will be  completed  by  parents  of  all  participants  with  age  <  18  years  and  also  by  patients 
themselves when age-appropriate self-complete versions are available.

 In participants diagnosed at  age  13-18 years, this assessment  may replace one  of the  assessments at  one  of the  other 
three time points in this Table. For those diagnosed at age 19 or older, this assessment will not be relevant. 
 
 
Health Status, including neuro-cognitive and behavioural outcome 
The Health Utilities Index (HUI)(Feeny, Furlong et al. 1995) is a 15-item plus one ‘global’ question, 
wide  ranging  measure  of  health  status,  which  allows  comparison  of  global  Health  Status  or  of  the 
‘attributes’ of vision, hearing, speech, dexterity, ambulation, cognition, emotion, and pain. This has 
been found to be sensitive to clinical problems (excepting behavioural problems) in populations of 
children  who  have  been  treated  for  brain  tumours (Kennedy  and  Leyland  1999),  including 
medulloblastoma.(Le Gales, Costet et al. 1999)  
 
The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)(Goodman 1999) is a 25-item questionnaire with 
subscales  for  hyperactivity,  emotional  symptoms,  conduct  problems,  peer  relationships,  and  pro-
social behaviour. These problems are very prevalent among children with brain tumours.(Kennedy 
and Leyland 1999) Both the HUI and the SDQ are available in many European languages and provide 
a concise description of the health status and behaviour of children involved in clinical trials. 
The  Behavior  Rating  Inventory  of  Executive  Function  (BRIEF)  parent  questionnaire (Gioia  2000) 
contains 86 items in eight non-overlapping clinical scales and two validity scales. These theoretically 
and statistically derived scales form two broader Indexes: Behavioral Regulation (three scales) and 
Meta-cognition (five scales), as well as a Global Executive Composite score. Factor analytic studies 
and structural equation modeling provide support for the two-factor model of executive functioning 
as  encompassed  by  the  two  Indexes.  Validity  scales  measure  Negativity  and  Inconsistency  of 
responses.  
 
Perception of Health and Well-being 
QoL evaluations will be undertaken Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory(Varni, Seid et al. 1999) and 
the PedsQL Fatigue scale.(Varni, Burwinkle et al. 2002) The PedsQL is a self administered multi-
dimensional measure of HRQL in healthy children and adolescents and those with acute and chronic

health conditions.  It is designed for use with children as reported by parents of children aged between 
two and 18 years, and for children themselves aged between five and 18 years.  It consists of 23 items, 
takes  approximately  five  minutes  to  complete,  and  provides  information  about  functioning  in  four 
dimensions: physical (eight items), emotional (five items), social (five items) and school (five items). 
 
In  place  of  the  PedsQL,  adult  participants,  aged  more  than  18  years,  will  complete  the  European 
Organisation    for    the    Research    and    Treatment    of    Cancer-C30    (EORTC    QLQ-C30) 
questionnaire.(Aaronson,  Ahmedzai  et  al.  1993) Instead  of  the  PedsQL-Fatigue  Module,  the 
Multidimensional  Fatigue  Inventory  (Smets, Garssen et  al. 1995) is  used  to  assess  the  amount  of 
fatigue in patients aged more than 18 years. 
 
Socio-Demographic, Educational and Employment Questions 
Relevant information on socio-demographic, educational and employment issues will be assessed by 
the Medical Educational Employment and Social Questionnaire (Glaser, Kennedy et al. 1999), which 
was also used and well-accepted by patients and parents in PNET 4. For PNET 5, the questionnaire 
was slightly modified and shortened, the modifications were agreed in expert-discussions in 2010 and 
2011. Parallelized self- and proxy versions are available. Translations and backward translations in 
languages of all incorporated European countries were provided. The questionnaire needs about 10-
15 minutes for completion. 
 
Data acquisition  
The on-line neuro-oncology module of HealthTracker (HT) was created in the UK and translated into 
seven  other  European   languages  in  2011-13.  It  is  comprised  of  a  ‘Patient  Portal’  and  an 
‘Administration Portal’. On-line documentation within HT is performed automatically by the patients 
and  parents  providing  their  questionnaire  responses  on  HT,  whether  in  patient’s  homes,  or  in 
hospitals, schools or public libraries. 
For patients with limited on-line access or for whom on-line data entry is judged inappropriate by the 
national QoS leads, documentation of their paper-and-pencil responses is an alternative method of 
collecting patient-reported baseline and outcome data. In this case, the entry of these data into the HT 
database  can  be  achieved,  either  by  the  PNET5  national  QoS  lead  team  or  by  the  PNET5  QoS 
international data coordinator, using the Patient Portal. In countries where paper booklets are used to 
collect the questionnaire responses of some trial participants, national QoS leads will agree with the 
PNET5 QoS international data coordinator their preference between entry of these data by PNET5 
QoS international data coordinator or entry at a national level by the national QoS lead team. This 
use  of  HT  to  enter  paper-and-pencil  responses  should  be  agreed  by  the  national  QoS-lead  and  the 
international study PIs. 
QoS on-line data thus obtained, entered either as patients/parents on-line responses or as paper-and-
pencil responses subsequently entered into the HT database as described above, will be downloaded 
from HT at regular intervals and included in the central PNET5 SAS or SPSS data base on which all 
trial analyses will be based.  
Communication  with  and  reminders  to  families  about  the  need  to  provide  data  on  HealthTracker, 
whether from a national QoS centre or from the centre at which the patient’s care is delivered, can be 
done either via the national postal system or via email but use of email would require the patient’s 
families’ email address to be available and is not essential for the use of HealthTracker. Consent for 
the use of email addresses for this purpose would be required.

9.4.2. Audiology 
Monitoring of hearing loss will be a fundamental and mandatory part of the study. 
 
Ear-specific  pure-tone  audiometry  should  be  performed  by  licensed  audiologists  experienced  in 
paediatric populations.  Sensorineural  Hearing  Threshold  (dB  HL)  should  be  evaluated  using  bone 
conduction or air conduction with normal tympanogram. 
 
Pure-tone audiometry should be performed before the onset of postoperative therapy:   
Patients can only be included into the PNET 5 MB - LR or PNET 5 MB - SR study, if there is no 
significant sensineural hearing deficit as define by pure tone audiomentry, separately performed for 
both ears, with bone conduction or air conduction and normal tympanogram shows no impairement 
≥ 20 dB at 1-3 kHz (best ear). If performance of pure tone audiometry is not possible postoperatively, 
normal otoacoustic emissions are acceptable, if there is no history of hearing deficit. (see inclusion 
criterion k, chapter 7.1. Inclusion Criteria, page 55). 
 
Note  that  for  surveillance  of  ototoxicity  on  maintenance  chemotherapy  a  PNET-4  based  grading 
system is used for recommendations of dose modifications. 
For evaluation of ototoxicity after chemotherapy as secondary outcome measure the Chang grading 
will be used. 
 
Chemotherapy dose modifications: 
Pure-tone   audiometry   is   mandatory before   every   cisplatin   (or   carboplatin)   containing 
maintenance chemotherapy cycle (course A): 
In case of sensineural hearing deficit, dose modifications of cisplatin, or substitution with carboplatin 
should  be  performed  according  to  the  recommendations  in  chapter 11.3.6.  Administration  of 
Chemotherapy – Regimen A, page 87. These dose modifications are based on the modification rules 
used in the HIT 91, HIT 2000 and PNET 4 studies 
Please  note,  that dose  modifications  should  be  performed based  on  the  highest  grade,  i.e.  the 
“worst ear”. Documentation of ototoxicities and possible dose modifications will be performed on 
the respective CRF.  
 
Ototoxicity as secondary outcome measure: 
After  end  of  therapy,  it  is  recommended  to  perform  pure-tone-audiomentry  2  and  5  years  after 
diagnosis (in case of hearing deficit, a closer follow-up might be appropriate). See chapter 12.3. Post-
treatment Follow-up, page 92. 
 
For  assessment  of  treatment-induced  ototoxicity,  one  original  audiogram  performed 2  years 
after diagnosis should be sent to the national coordinator.  
Grading  will  be  performed  according  to  the Chang ototoxicity  grading,  based  on  the  lowest 
grade, i.e. the “best ear”, as follows (Chang and Chinosornvatana 2010): 
 
Senineural  hearing  treashold,  evaluated  by  bone  conduction  or  air  conduction  with  normal 
tympanogram: 
Chang Grade 0: ≤ 20 dB at 1,2, and 4 kHz 
Chang Grade 1a:  ≥ 40 dB at any frequency 6 to 12 kHz 
Chang Grade 1b: > 20 and < 40 dB at 4 kHz 
Chang Grade 2a:  ≥ 40 dB at 4 kHz and above 
Chang Grade 2b: > 20 and < 40 dB at any frequency below 4 kHz 
Chang Grade 3: ≥ 40 dB at 2 or 3 kHz and above 
Chang Grade 4:  ≥ 40 dB at 1 kHz and above

9.4.3. Endocrine Function 
Hormone Status is important for interpretation of Quality of Survival data and should be collected at 
the same time points. Those patients already 18 years of age at 2 or 5 years after diagnosis, will have 
reduced assessments due to the co-incidence of those time points. 
Data to be collected: Height prior to radiotherapy, weight, Age at menarche in girls, Date of starting 
and  discontinuing  supplemental  hormone  therapies,  birth  weight, gestational  age  at  birth, parental 
heights.  Blood  FSH  will  be  collected  as  a  biomarker  for  subfertility,  (cycletimed  to  D2-5  in 
spontaneously cycling females).

Presence   and   severity   of   posterior   fossa   syndrome   will   be   evaluated before   the   onset   of 
radiotherapy   and   at   least 3 weeks   after   surgery by   the   cerebellar   mutism   syndrome 
survey.(Robertson, Muraszko et al. 2006).

Presence and severity of ataxia will be evaluated in timely analogy to endocrinology and QoS reports, 
before radiotherapy, 2 and 5 years after diagnosis, and at age 18. The brief ataxia rating scale 
will be used for evaluation.(Schmahmann, Gardner et al. 2009).

10. Study Entry  
 
Patients  will  be  considered  as  included  in  the PNET  5  MB  study after  informed  consent  has  been 
signed and eligibility criteria have been verified. 
 
Any eligible patient who is not included in the study, due to the decision of patient, parent or 
physician, should   receive   treatment   in   accordance   with   the   recommendations   of   the 
appropriate National Group. 
 
It  is  recommended  to  register  (anonymously)  the  number  of  non-included  eligible  patients  and 
reasons for exclusion. Due to different national policies, this cannot be organised centrally. National 
centers are asked to establish methods for registration. 
 
Eligible patients will be assigned to either the PNET 5 MB - LR or PNET 5 MB - SR study arm on 
the basis of their WNT subgroup status. 
 
PNET 5 MB - LR is an open, non-comparative study, and patients will therefore not be randomised. 
 
PNET 5 MB - SR is a randomised, comparative study. Patients will be randomised to receive either 
radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy and carboplatin 35 mg/m
2
 5 times per week. All patients will then 
receive maintenance chemotherapy. 
 
The National Data Centre will make the following information available to the national QoS lead at 
the time that registration on Marvin is completed, including 
• the patient’s Marvin number,  
• date  of birth or,  if  this  is  not  compatible  with  national  rules,  decimal  age  at first tumour 
 surgery,  
• date of first tumour surgery, 
• gender,  
• treatment allocation, 
• hospital, and 
• name of local investigator. 
 
These  details  will  be  manually  entered  into  HT  either  by  the  national  PNET  QoS  lead  team  or,  if 
preferred by that team, by the PNET 5 QoS international data coordinator in Southampton.  
 
Finally, patients’ families have the option to give consent to provide their contact details including 
email address and to be contacted by the national QoS team. Contact details will be stored separetaly 
from study data by the national QoS coordinator. 
 
 
Randomisation in PNET 5 MB - SR 
The  randomisation  lists  will  be provided  to  the  randomisation  centres  by  the  reference  center  for 
Biostatistics (A. Faldum and R. Kwiecien, Münster, Germany). A block randomisation will be used 
and randomisation will be stratified by gender, age and residual tumour. 
 
This study will follow the priniciples of “Good Clinical Practice (GCP)” provided by the International 
Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) as well as the Declaration of Helsinki.

11. Treatment Details  
 
11.1. Supportive Care 
Supportive care should be applied as to the standard of the treating centre. 
 
Steroids:  Patients   should   not   receive   steroid   therapy,   e.g.   dexamethasone,   during 
radiotherapy  and  chemotherapy,  if  at  all  possible.  If  symptoms  of  raised  intra-
cranial pressure develop during treatment the cause, e.g. hydrocephalus, should be 
actively sought. Steroids should be used as a short-term measure prior to definitive 
treatment  of  the  raised  pressure.  Use  of  dexamethasone  should  be  documented 
prospectively.  
 
Pneumocystis: During radiotherapy and during chemotherapy pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis is 
recommended according to local practice.  
 
Fungal proph.: A local fungal prophylaxis is recommended during radiotherapy, e.g. with Nystatin, 
Amphothericin   B   or Natamycin.   A   systemic   fungal   prophylaxis   might   be 
considered according to national standards.  
 
Anti-emesis: For antiemesis, a 5HT3 antagonist should be used (mandatory for anti-emesis for 
cisplatin-containing chemotherapy). Dexamethasone should not be used as an anti-
emetic unless other therapies fail. 
 
Fertility: As  infertility  is  a  possible  consequence  of  the  treatment,  treating  physicians  are 
asked  to  recommend  cryoconservation  of  semen  or  other  measures,  whenever 
appropriate.  
 
 
11.2. Radiotherapy Phase  
11.2.1. Timing of Radiotherapy (RT) 
Following  definitive  surgery - all  patients  shall  begin  RT  within  28  days  after  surgery.  Starting 
radiotherapy more than 40 days post surgery renders the patient ineligible for the study. 
 
11.2.2. Equipment  
Patients enrolled in the study must be treated using conformal radiation therapy treatment planning 
and delivery techniques. IMRT techniques will be allowed assuming that appropriate departmental 
QA  procedures  are  available  and  prospectively  approved  by  the  national  study  co-ordinator.  A 
primary  IMRT  approach  (including  arcing  techniques  e.g.  tomotherapy,  VMAT,  RapidArc)  must 
ensure adequate irradiation of the target volume  allowing for tissue heterogeneity  and the junction 
between  the  cranial  fields  and  spinal  field  can  be  precisely  calculated  and  implemented  and  a 
sufficient  dose  gradient  is  employed  over  the  vertebral  bodies  to  ensure  symmetrical  bone  growth 
arrest. All patients must be treated on isocentric linear accelerators with a minimum source-to-axis 
distance (SAD) of 80 cm.  Megavoltage photons  with  a nominal energy ≥  4 MV must be used. 
Treatment with 
60
Co is not permitted. 
 
The use of electron spinal fields will be acceptable provided a beam of sufficient energy is available 
to ensure adequate irradiation of the target volume allowing for tissue heterogeneity and the junction 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
78 
between  the  photon  cranial  fields  and  spinal  electron  field  can  be  precisely  calculated  and 
implemented.  
 
Equally primary proton therapy (for both phases) is acceptable assuming an adequate coverage of the 
entire vertebral body to minimise the risk of asymmetrical bone growth arrest. 
 
11.2.3. Energy 
The cranial (whole brain) fields shall be treated with megavoltage photons with energies in the range 
of 4-6 MV.  Energies higher than 6 MV should be avoided due to the risk of under-dosing the lateral 
meninges.  The tumour bed RT can be given with a higher energy if deemed dosimetrically beneficial. 
Photons of 4-6 MV will generally be used for spinal irradiation but electrons of suitable energy or 
protons can be used as an alternative.  
 
11.2.4. Treatment position 
Patients should be immobilised using an immobilisation device according to departmental policies. 
The patient should be maintained in the same position for the cranial and spinal components of CSRT 
for the duration of this treatment phase.  
 
11.2.5. RT planning  
A planning CT is mandatory  for the definition of the target volumes of both craniospinal axis and 
tumour bed. It is strongly recommended that the CT slice thickness should be no greater than 0.5 cm 
in the region of the cribriform fossa, base of skull, posterior fossa and cranio-cervical field junction 
(ideally 2.5 mm or smaller), and no greater than 1.0 cm elsewhere within the craniospinal axis.    
 
If  the  spinal  field  is  treated  with  electron  beams  the  dose  along  the  entire  spinal  axis  should  be 
calculated with an appropriate correction for tissue heterogeneity.  
 
11.2.6. Treatment volume, anatomical description and dose 
Target Volume 
Target volumes will be defined according to ICRU 50/62 guidelines. Delineation of all target volumes 
is based on a planning CT with i.v. contrast and/ or CT-MR image fusion and will be outlined on each 
slice of the planning scan. 
 
Craniospinal Axis:  
The Clinical Target Volume (CTV) for CSRT comprises the whole brain as well as the spinal cord 
and thecal sac to the dura. 
 
Whole Brain Volume: 
The whole brain CTV should extend anteriorly to include the entire frontal lobe and cribriform plate 
region. In order to include the cribriform fossa within the CTV, and allowing an additional appropriate 
margin for PTV, the edge of the field (i.e. the geometric edge of the shielding block) would in many 
cases include the lenses.  
The  geometric  edge  of  the  shielding  should  extend  at  least  0.5  cm  inferiorly  below  the  cribriform 
plate and at least 1 cm elsewhere below the base of the skull.  The margin between the shielding and 
the anterior border of the upper cervical vertebrae should be 0.5 cm. The lower border of the cranial 
fields should form a precise match with the upper border of the spinal field. 
 
The CTV must include any herniation of the meninges through the craniotomy scar  
  

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
79 
Cervical Spinal Volume  
The spinal field should extend superiorly to form an accurate match with the border with the lower 
borders of the cranial fields. 
 
Dorso-Lumbar Spine Volume 
The inferior limit of the spinal CTV must be determined by imaging the lower limit of the thecal sac 
on a spinal MR performed as part of the staging process. The treatment field edge will set 1 cm below 
the lowest point of the thecal sac as visualised on MRI.   
 
Width of the Spinal Volume  
The aim is to include the entire subarachnoid space including the extensions along the nerve roots as 
far  as  the  intervertebral  foramena.  Thus  the  spinal  CTV  should  extend  laterally  to  cover  the 
intervertebral foramina. An additional margin, generally 1.0 cm on either side should be added for 
PTV, and an appropriate field width chosen to allow for this. The use of a ‘spade’ shaped field to 
treat the lumbo-sacral spine is not recommended. 
 
Tumour Bed Volume 
The GTV includes all gross residual tumour and/or the walls of the resection cavity at the primary 
site, based on the initial imaging examination that defines the tissue initially involved with disease 
anatomically and the post-operative and pre-irradiation neuro-imaging examinations. The GTV will 
have to take into account any anatomical shift or changes after surgery.  
 
The  CTV  includes  the  GTV  with  an  added  margin  that  is  meant  to  treat  sub-clinical  microscopic 
disease and is anatomically confined (i.e. the CTV is limited to the confines of the bony calvarium 
and  tentorium  where  applicable).  The  CTV  is  defined  as  the  GTV  plus  a  1.0 cm  margin  except  at 
bone or tentorial interface where it remains within the confines of the posterior fossa. 
 
The  PTV  is  defined  as the  CTV  plus  an  additional  0.3 - 0.5 cm  margin.  The  size  of  the  required 
margin  will  depend  on  the  quality  of  the  immobilisation  device  chosen  and  the  departmental 
reproducibility records for the patient position and chosen device. If a local investigator feels that a 
0.5 cm margin is insufficient as a CTV/PTV margin, the radiotherapy principal investigator should 
be informed and the case should be discussed. CAVE: The final PTV should not extend beyond the 
boundaries of a “classical” PTV when the entire posterior fossa is defined as CTV unless clinically 
indicated.  
 
A  field  arrangement  using  3D  conformal  planning  is  a  mandatory  requirement.  At  least  the  use  of 
posterior oblique fields is strongly recommended. The purpose of this is to minimise the RT dose to 
the middle ears and temporal lobes. A beam arrangement of a parallel opposed pair is not permitted. 
 
Organs at risk (OR) 
The following minimum number of OR must be defined for 3-D conformal radiation therapy or IMRT 
planning: 
 
 Supratentorial brain 
 Posterior fossa (infratentorial brain) 
 Cochlea (left and right) 
 Optic chiasm 
 Temporal lobes (left / right) 
 Hippocampus (left / right) 
 Thyroid gland 
 Pituitary 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17

The supratentorial volume for OR definition is defined as whole brain volume (down to the foramen 
magnum) minus the posterior fossa volume. 
 
The posterior fossa volume for OR definition is defined as: 
 Superiorly -  the tentorium  
 Inferiorly -  the extension of the spinal meninges 2 cm below the lower limit of the tumour 
as defined on the pre-operative scan.  The resulting inferior field edge should at least include 
the outer table of the skull at the foramen magnum. 
 Anteriorly -  the anterior edge of the brain stem.  
 Posteriorly -  the posterior extension of the meninges to the inner table of the skull.   
The CTV does not need to include any herniation of the meninges through the 
craniotomy defect.    
 Laterally -  the lateral extension of the meninges around the cerebellum 
 
The  study will  prospectively  record  the  mean  and  maximum  dose  to  OR  in  order  to  allow  future 
analysis of late toxicity.  
 
Dose Specification  
 
Dose Definition: All doses will be specified according to ICRU 50/ICRU 62.  
 
Reference Point  
 
Brain  
If the brain is treated by a pair of parallel opposed fields, the dose should be defined at the midpoint 
of the central axis.   
 
Spine  
The dose to the spine should be prescribed along the central axis at a depth representing the posterior 
margin of the vertebral bodies.  
In the case of electron RT to the spine the anterior border of the target volume (posterior aspect of 
the vertebral bodies) must be encompassed within the 85% isodose.  
 
Tumour bed boost  
The primary tumour bed should be treated, using a suitable technique that allows for the least amount 
of normal brain tissue and organs to be at risk from exposure to high dose irradiation. The prescription 
point should be the isocentre unless an IMRT technique is used.  
 
Dose prescription  
 
PNET 5 MB - LR: 
Brain – 18.0 Gy in 10 daily fractions of 1.80 Gy  
Spine - 18.0 Gy in 10 daily fractions of 1.80 Gy  
Primary tumour boost – 36.0 Gy in 20 daily fractions of 1.80 Gy  
 
Total dose to primary – 54 Gy in 30 daily fractions of 1.80 Gy  
 
  

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
81 
PNET 5 MB - SR: 
Brain – 23.40 Gy in 13 daily fractions of 1.80 Gy  
Spine - 23.40 Gy in 13 daily fractions of 1.80 Gy  
Primary tumour boost – 30.60 Gy in 17 daily fractions of 1.80 Gy  
 
Total dose to primary – 54 Gy in 30 daily fractions of 1.80 Gy  
 
The mean dose to both cochleas will be limited to 30 Gy. In case of a conflict of the mean cochlea 
dose constraint with the GTV and CTV dose prescription, priority has to be given to cover the GTV 
and  CTV.  The  CTV  to  PTV  margin  maybe  compromised  in  selected  cases  if  deemed  clinically 
acceptable. 
 
Fractionation 
All fields should be treated daily (conventional RT) 5 days per week.  
 
Dose uniformity 
Dose variations across the target volume should be within + 7% and – 5% of the prescription point 
according  to  ICRU  50/62 recommendations.  If  technically  achievable,  the  dose  variation  should 
preferentially be kept within ± 5%. An effort should be made to spare the cochlea and middle ear in 
view of the subsequent platinum based consolidation chemotherapy. 
 
Field shaping 
The  use  of  customised  divergent  beam  blocks  or  multi-leaf  collimators  using  beam’s  eye  view 
facilities is mandatory. 
 
Treatment verification 
Regular treatment verification according to institutional policies is required. As a minimum standard, 
weekly portal images must be performed and the set-up variations recorded. 
 
Rests  
There will be no planned rests. Delays due to machine services and bank holidays should be avoided 
wherever possible.   
 
11.2.7. Treatment Technique  
Cranial RT 
The cranial fields will be treated with lateral opposed fields. 
 
Spine Irradiation  
If possible the spinal volume should be treated with a single posterior field. If necessary the spinal 
field can be treated at an extended FSD. The exit from the spinal field should not include the teeth 
and jaw.  
 
Junctions 
Junctions of abutting fields should be moved on a regular basis either intra fractionally, daily or by 
other predefined time points (moving junction technique). 
 
Primary Tumour Bed Volume 
It  is  mandatory  that  this  volume  is  treated  conformally.  The  field  arrangement  will  be  chosen  to 
provide a high conformity index and to minimise the RT dose to OARs.  
  

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
82 
Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) 
It  is  likely  that  during  the  duration  of  this  study,  IMRT  planning  and  delivery  techniques  will  be 
increasingly employed. As an example, this may be used as an option for reducing the radiation dose 
to the cochlea.  IMRT has also been used to improve homogeneity of spinal RT. If centres employ 
IMRT then it will be essential to observe strict criteria for immobilisation and departmental quality 
assurance.  
 
Proton Beam Therapy 
Proton Beam Therapy will be increasingly available and is attractive to reduce dose to normal tissues 
i.e.  colchlea,  lenses,  non-involved  brain  or  pituitary.  Due  to  smaller  volume  receiving  low  and 
medium dose, theoretically also the secondary malignancies risk may decrease. Proton technology is 
still  evolving  and  the  delivery  of  cranisopinal  treatment  will  be  provided  only  in  few  places 
worldwide.  For  posterior  fossa  treatment  rotating  gantries  seem  to  be  advisable  as  compared  to 
horizontal  beam  lines  only  capable  of  achieving  lateral  beam  arrangements.  As  there  is  some 
uncertainty  about  increased  RBE (relative  biological effectiveness) at  the  distal  Bragg  peak, 
weighthing  of  spots  and Bragg  peaks  need  to  be  carefully  evaluated.  The  use  of  multiple  field 
techniques might be preferable if high weighted spots cumulate in critical areas. As with conventional 
treatment, organ tolerances as well as target coverage are to be respected. 
 
11.2.8. Quality control of radiotherapy  
Radiotherapy  for  patients  with  the  diagnosis  of  a  medulloblastoma  requires  a  complex  treatment 
technique. It has been previously clearly demonstrated that the relapse risk is closely related to the 
quality of radiotherapy. 
 
Thus  in  PNET  5 quality  control  (QC)  of  the  radiation  technique  is  considered  a  fundamental  and 
mandatory component  of  the  study.  QC  will  be principally  performed prior to  the  start  of 
radiotherapy.  
 
General Organisation of Radiotherapy QC 
 
 Radiotherapy QC will be organised and undertaken on a National basis.  This should include a 
procedure to reproduce and check target volumes and dose prescription.  
 
 Each National Group will appoint a National Radiotherapy Coordinator 
 
 The National Radiotherapy QC Coordinator will work in close co-operation with two to three 
named radiotherapy colleagues forming the National Radiotherapy QC panel. This will ensure 
the constant availability of a QC assessor without delay. Submitted films will be assessed and 
returned  (if  originals  were  submitted)  within  72  hours  following  receipt.  Otherwise  the 
submitting  center  will  be  informed  via  fax  or  e-mail  of  the  QC  assessment  result.  Once  the 
individual  clinician  submitting  the  case  has  receive  either  by  e-mail  or  fax  a  copy  of  the  QA 
review  highlighting  a  major  deviation  detected  he/she  will  be  responsible  for  addressing  the 
recommendation of the QA review in the final treatment plan delivered.  
 
 Submission of planning documentation – The use of DICOM RT compatible data entailing the 
treatment plan, conventional imaging or computer generated dose distributions may vary from 
country to country. Each national group will decide on the most appropriate way of submitting 
films  and plans  (i.e.  either  electronically  or  via  courier).  Guidance  can  be  obtained  from  the 
National Radiotherapy Coordinator.  
 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
83 
 Radiotherapy QC committees will meet three times a year. They will review the current status 
of  compliance  with  the  aim  of  prospective  QC  control  and  review  films  or  scans  submitted 
during  the  last  4  months.  They  will  provide  an  annual  report  that  will  include  any  targeting 
deviations.  This  report  will  be  sent  to  the  National  Study  Coordinator,  the  International 
Radiotherapy Coordinator and the International Data Centre. 
 
 Countries who do not wish to set up their own QC panel should at the start of the study identify 
the QC panel of a National Group of their choice, which - if agreed - will provide the prospective 
QC for them.  
 
Copies of the following imaging for treatment planning (e.g. simulator films, digitally reconstructed 
radiographs –DRR’s-) should be sent to the National Radiotherapy QC panel (preferably by electronic 
transfer of digitised images): 
 
1.  Whole brain field 
2.  Spinal field/fields 
 
Any targeting deviations will be defined  as either minor or major (Carrie  et al.   IJROBP 1999;45: 
435– 439). 
 
The deviation is defined as a margin between the field edge and the CTV of less than 5 mm for the 
cribriform fossa and less than 10 mm for field edges elsewhere within the whole brain. 
For the cribriform fossa a minor deviation is defined as a margin of 3-5 mm and a major deviation a 
margin of less than 3 mm.  
 
For the other regions a minor deviation is defined as a margin of 5-10 mm and a major deviation a 
margin of less than 5 mm. For details see radiotherapy data forms. 
 
For  all  other  cases  the  full  planning  DCOM-RT  dataset  will  be  made  available  to  the  national  QC 
panel who will review it in accordance with the designed QA CRF.  
 
QC review of posterior fossa and tumour bed  
QC review of posterior fossa and tumour bed target volumes will be offered by the national RT QC 
committees.  
 
 
 Radiotherapy  QC  of  the  tumour  bed  component  is not mandatory  unless  the  patient 
experiences a posterior fossa relapse (see below) in which case a retrospective QC review is 
mandatory.   
 
 Some  National  groups  may,  however,  wish  to  conduct  prospective  QC  of  tumour  bed 
radiotherapy. If such prospective QC is undertaken, then the National Radiotherapy QC panel 
will be responsible for determining the criteria by which posterior fossa treatment techniques 
are evaluated.  
 
 All patients who relapse within the posterior fossa either alone or in combination with other 
sites will undergo a separate radiotherapy QC. Treating centers will be requested to provide 
the  documentation  of  their  posterior  fossa  and/or tumour bed  boost  together  with  the 
diagnostic imaging at diagnosis and relapse within 3 months form the reported time of relapse. 
The radiotherapy QC panel, in collaboration with appropriate neuro-radiologists if indicated, 
will determine the exact site of relapse as a function of the irradiation volume.

11.2.9. Treatment Modifications due to Haematological Toxicity 
In all patients blood cell count should be controlled twice a week during radiotherapy (3 times per 
week, if carboplatin is administered; see guidelines on G-CSF administration in chapter 11.3.2.).  
Treatment  will  not  be  interrupted  for  anaemia,  leucopaenia  or  thrombocytopaenia  unless  life 
threatening.  Blood  product  or  growth  factor  support should be  instituted  according  to  institutional 
guidelines or according to protocol recommendations. Irradiated blood products should be used at all 
times. Transfusions are recommended when the haemoglobin levels fall below 10 g/l. Platelets should 
be transfused as clinically indicated, or when counts are ≤ 25 x 10
9
. In case of low absolute neutrophil 
count (≤ 0.5 x 10
9
) growth factors should be considered and given preferably during the weekends 
(see  chapter  11.3.2.).  Any  treatment  interruption  should  be  compensated  according  to  national  or 
institutional policies. 
 
11.3. Chemotherapy 
All chemotherapy doses given are based on Body Surface Area (BSA) and calculation of reference 
values in MARVIN database use the Mosteller formula: 
 
S (surface) [m
2
] = 
√
(퐿∗푀)/3600 
L = length [cm] 
M = weight [kg] 
 
There will be no dose adjustment for cachexic or obese patients. 
 
11.3.1. Carboplatin concomitant to Radiotherapy (PNET5 MB-SR only) 
All patients included in the PNET 5 MB - SR study will be randomized to either radiation therapy 
only  or  to  radiation  therapy  and carboplatin  at  35  mg/m
2
/day  intravenously  (IV)  over  15-60 
minutes, 5 times a week (Monday through Friday), 1-4 hours before radiation, for 6 weeks (30 
applications=total dose). Note that vincristine will not be given during radiotherapy in either arm. 
If radiation treatment is not given, carboplatin should not be given either. If a dose of carboplatin is 
administered and radiation therapy is not applied due to problems such as sedation, the carboplatin 
dose should not be made up, i.e. no more than 30 doses of carboplatin should be administered. The 
weight  of  the  patient  should  be  measured  and  documented  on  a  weekly  basis  to  allow  carboplatin 
dose adjustments due to weight changes. 
 
Recommendations on G-CSF administration 
Generally  we  recommend  the  use  of  G-CSF  over  the  weekends  and  only  in  cases  with  severe  and 
significant neutropenia during the week (i.e. in parallel with radiotherapy and chemotherapy). 
 
Complete  blood  counts  will  be  obtained  every  Monday,  Wednesday,  and  Friday.  If  absolute 
neutrophil count is 1000/L on any Friday, G-CSF will be administered subcutaneously or IV on 
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. G-CSF should not be given until after the radiation treatment on Friday 
has been delivered. If the absolute neutrophil count is >1000/L, no G-CSF will be administered that 
weekend. On any Monday or Wednesday, if the absolute neutrophil count is <500/L, G-CSF will 
be  administered  on  that  day  and  the  following  day  after  the  radiation  treatment.  If  the  absolute 
neutrophil count is 500/L on Monday or Wednesday, G-CSF will not be administered (see Table 
below).  Family  members  should  be  taught  to  administer  G-CSF.  G-CSF  guidelines  are  tabulated 
below: 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
85 
 
Guidelines for G-CSF administration during radiotherapy 
DAY CBC with diff, plts ANC 1000-500 ANC < 500 
Friday x 5 mcg/kg/day Fri., Sat., Sun. 5 mcg/kg/day Fri., Sat., Sun. 
Monday x No G-CSF 5 mcg/kg/day Mon., Tues. 
Wednesday x No G-CSF  5 mcg/kg/day Wed., Thur. 
There is to be no dose escalation of G-CSF for neutropenia alone. In the event of a potentially 
life-threatening infection with neutropenia, G-CSF may be increased to 5 mcg/kg 2x/day. 
 
Significant  myelosuppression  is  likely  to  occur,  particularly  during  the  last two-three  weeks  of 
radiation. However,   radiation and   carboplatin   treatment should   not   be   withheld   for 
myelosuppression alone. Radiation should be continued even if the patient is hospitalized with 
fever  and  neutropenia  as  long  as  the  patient  is  clinically stable.  Administration  of  the  boost 
should not be substituted for craniospinal radiation in the face of low counts.  
 
Non-hematological toxicities during radiotherapy with concomitant carboplatin treatment 
The  most  common  non-hematological  toxicity  encountered  for  radiochemotherapy  containing 
carboplatin treatment in COG 99701 was esophagitis, followed by loss of skin integrity, and nausea 
/  vomiting.  However,  interruptions  of  radiochemotherapy  due  to  these reasons  were  uncommon, 
therefore  no  specific  recommendations  for  interruptions  due  to  non-hematological  toxicities  are 
defined within PNET 5 MB - SR. Please contact coordinator in any case of severe non-hematological 
toxicity which might necessicate treatment interruption. 
 
11.3.2. Investigations before the Maintenance Chemotherapy Phase 
The following investigations should be performed just before 6 weeks after the end of 
radiotherapy: 
a) Clinical exam with neurological exam. 
b) Cranial MRI with and without contrast injection. 
c) MRI of spine to include visualisation with complete visualisation of the dural sac. 
d) Audiology – Pure Tone Audiometry, air conduction if needed combined with tympanogram, or 
bone conduction. 
e) Full blood count. 
f) Blood biochemistry – electrolytes (ionogram), urea, creatinine, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, 
bilirubin, albumin, magnesium, calcium, phosphate. 
g) Glomerular filtration rate - by clearance of radioisotope or creatinine clearance.

11.3.4. Investigations Before Each Course of Chemotherapy 
a) Clinical exam with neurological exam. 
b) Full blood count. 
c) Blood biochemistry – electrolytes (ionogram), urea, creatinine, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, 
bilirubin, albumin, magnesium, calcium, phosphate, creatinine). 
 
11.3.5. Investigations Before Alternate Courses of Chemotherapy 
All of the above plus: 
a)   Audiology   (mandatory   before   cisplatin or   carboplatin containing   courses) – Pure   Tone 
Audiometry, air conduction if needed combined with tympanogram, or bone conduction.

courses  
Requirements  for  start  of  the  courses  are  described  in the  chapter 11.3.7.  Modification  of  Dose  of 
Chemotherapy – Regimen A, page 87, and chapter 11.3.9. Modification of Dose of Chemotherapy – 
Regimen B, page 90, respectively for specific requirements for start of chemotherapy. 
 
  

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
87 
11.3.6. Administration of Chemotherapy – Regimen A 
Chemotherapy for Regimen A consists of cisplatin, CCNU and vincristine, at the following doses: 
  
-  Cisplatin: 70 mg/m
2
 intravenously (6 hour infusion) - day 1 
- CCNU  (lomustine): 75  mg/  m
2
 orally - day  1 (Whenever  possible  patients  should  be 
encouraged to swallow the capsules whole, without chewing or crushing. If this is not possible 
capsules may be opened and the content administered according to local practice. Mixtures of 
lomustine in water are unstable and should be administered immediately after preparation.) 
- VCR (vincristine): 1.5 mg/m
2
 intravenously (max. dose 2 mg) - day 1, 8 and 15 (VCR may 
be given as a bolus or short infusion as necessary to comply with local or national guidelines 
to prevent inadvertent intrathecal administration) 
 
In the context of a multicentre international study, it is appreciated that different national groups and 
individual centres have varying but well established methods of administering cisplatin. 
 
The  following  considerations  are,  however,  considered  mandatory  for  the PNET  5  MB - LR and 
PNET 5 MB - SR studies: 
 
 Cisplatin to be given as an infusion over 6 hours 
 Hyperhydration to be used to maintain an adequate urine output 
 The use of mannitol to enhance urine output 
 The addition of calcium, magnesium and potassium to hydration fluids 
 The use of 5HT3 antagonists for anti-emesis 
 Careful monitoring of urine output with appropriate guidelines for treatment of insufficient 
urine output 
 
Administration  of  carboplatin (if  indicated  as  substitute  for cisplatin  during  maintenance 
chemotherapy) 
Carboplatin 400 mg/m
2 
is to be given as a 1-hour infusion. 
The  choice  of  fluid  for  administration  and  any  pre- or  post-chemotherapy  fluids  will  be  at  the 
discretion of the centre/group. 
 
11.3.7. Modification of Dose of Chemotherapy – Regimen A 
The  following  guidelines  on  the  monitoring  of  toxicity  of  chemotherapy  in  Regimen  A and 
modification of the dose of chemotherapy do not replace individual responsibility for patient care! 
For additional advice, contact the national coordinator. 
Before each course of chemotherapy, the patient’s overall clinical status should be good. 
Haematology 
A full blood count (FBC) should be performed at least every 2 weeks after the start of each course 
of chemotherapy.

Neurotoxicity of Vincristine 
Epileptic seizure or Stop vincristine in this course and 
Ileus  reduce vincristine to 1 mg/m
2
 
   in the next course. 
 
After recovery  Aim to give vincristine at 100% doses 
  as tolerated 
 
Significant dysaesthesia, muscle weakness Omit vincristine until recovery 
or abdominal pain 
 
After recovery  Aim to give vincristine at 100% doses 
  as tolerated 
 
Nephrotoxicity 
 Nephrotoxicity is a major toxicity concern with cisplatin. Both glomerular and tubular toxicity 
must be monitored during treatment with cisplatin. 
 Dose modification is based on glomerular toxicity i.e. a reduction in Glomerular Filtration Rate 
(GFR). 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
89 
 In the context of a multicentre international study, it is appreciated that different national groups 
and individual centres have varying but well-established methods of measuring or estimating 
GFR.  These  include  methods  based  on  blood  clearance  of  radioisotope,  e.g.  MAG3  and 
clearance of 51Cr EDTA or Tc99m DTPA, estimation of creatinine clearance from the plasma 
creatinine  level  (e.g.  using  the  Schwartz  formula)  or  by  direct  measurement  of  urinary 
creatinine clearance.    
 Any  well  established  method  of  estimating  GFR  as  detailed  above  may  be  used  prior  to 
chemotherapy.   
 The estimation of GFR must be performed before every cisplatin containing course (course A). 
 
Serum creatinine > 1.2 mg/dL (100M) or Delay chemotherapy for 1 week. 
  > 1.5 ULN or  
GFR/Creatinine clearance < 80 ml/min per 1.73 m
2
 
  
If no recovery Perform estimation of GFR by 
  clearance of radioisotope. 
 
Isotope GFR > 60 and < 80 ml/min per 1.73 m
2
 Use carboplatin 400 mg/m
2
 
instead of cisplatin for next course. 
  Perform estimation of GFR by 
clearance of radioisotope before next 
course. 
 
Isotope GFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73m
2
 
Omit any platinum for next  
  course. 
  Perform estimation of GFR by 
clearance of radioisotope before next 
course. 
 
Ototoxicty 
Due to the ototoxic potential of the platin analogues, a Pure Tone Audiometry is mandatory before 
each cisplatin (or carboplatin) containing course. It should be performed either by air conduction, if 
necessary  combined  with  a  typanogram  to  exclude  problems  with  air  conduction,  or  by  bone

11.3.8. Administration of Chemotherapy – Regimen B 
Chemotherapy for Regimen B consists of cyclophosphamide and vincristine at the following doses:  
- cyclophosphamide: 1x 1000 mg/m
2
/d given as IV infusion, over one hour, once daily, days 
1-2 
- vincristine: 1.5 mg/m
2
 intravenously (max. dose 2 mg) - day 1 (VCR may be given as a bolus 
or short infusion as necessary to comply with local or national guidelines to prevent inadvertent 
intrathecal administration) 
- MESNA: The use of MESNA to reduce the risk of urothelial toxicity is at the discretion of 
local centres, who may  follow their established practice.  If  gross hematuria occurs on Day 1 
MESNA  should  be  increased  in  the  first  instance  if  previously  administered,  or  added if  not 
previously given. Cyclophosphamide may be omitted on day 2 at the discretion of the treating 
physician. In the following course MESNA should be given in a dose of at least 120% of the 
dose of cyclophosphamide with hyper-hydration. The dose of cyclophosphamide may be halved 
(500 mg/m2) on both days 1 & 2 if this is considered necessary. If well tolerated the standard 
dose should be administered in subsequent courses with MESNA and hyper-hydration. 
Recommendation: 250mg/m

Nephrotoxicity: 
If there  is  a  known  renal  toxicity  due  to  previous  platin chemotherapy,  renal  function  should  be 
assessed prior to cyclophosphamide.

/d) in the following course and if well tolerated use normal dose again 
afterwards. 
The use of MESNA to reduce the risk of urothelial toxicity is at the discretion of local centres, who 
may  follow  their  established  practice.  If  gross  hematuria  occurs  on  Day  1 MESNA  should  be 
increased  in  the  first  instance  if  previously  administered,  or  added  if  not  previously  given. 
Cyclophosphamide  may  be  omitted  on  day  2  at  the  discretion  of  the  treating  physician.  In  the 
following course MESNA should be given in a dose of at least 120% of the dose of cyclophosphamide 
with hyper-hydration. The dose of cyclophosphamide may be halved (500 mg/m2) on both days 1 & 
2  if  this  is  considered  necessary.  If  well  tolerated  the  standard  dose  should  be  administered  in 
subsequent courses with MESNA and hyper-hydration. 
 
11.3.10. Investigations after Three and Six Courses of Chemotherapy and After Final Course 
of Chemotherapy  
a)  Cranial MRI with and without contrast injection. 
b)  Spinal MRI with complete visualization of the dural sac. 
 
11.4. Description of investigational medicinal products 
All of the above named drugs are defined as investigational medicinal products (IMPs): Carboplatin, 
Cisplatin, Vincristine, CCNU, and Cyclophosphamide. 
The    use    of    these    drugs    is    current    standard    of    care    for paediatric patients    with 
medulloblastoma,(Kortmann, Kuhl et al. 2000; Taylor, Bailey et al. 2003; Packer, Gajjar et al. 2006; 
Jakacki, Burger et al. 2012; Lannering, Rutkowski et al. 2012) (see also introduction section) and the 
design  of  the  two  study  arms  is  experimental  only  regarding  to  the  treatment  schedule  and  the 
cumulative dosing and not in respect of the use of the substances.  
Details on administration and dose modifications are given in chapter 11. 
 
All of these drugs are licensed medicinal products which are commercially available within the EU. 
Therefore labelling is not required. 
Information Sheets for Health Professionals (SmPCs in the UK) are included in appendix K of the 
protocol.

12. Summary of Follow-up 
 
12.1. Follow-up during Treatment 
For estimation of efficacy of treatment: 
- Cranial MRI with and without contrast injection 
- Spinal MRI  
should be performed before the start of maintenance chemotherapy (see chapter 11.3.2. Investigations 
before  the  Maintenance  Chemotherapy  Phase,  page 85),  and  after  three,  and  six  courses  of 
maintenance  chemotherapy  (see  chapter 11.3.10.  Investigations after Three  and  Six  Courses  of 
Chemotherapy and After Final Course of Chemotherapy, page 91). 
 
Monitoring for therapy associated toxicity should be performed according to the recommendations 
given in the chapters 11.3.4. Investigations Before Each Course of Chemotherapy, page 86, 11.3.7. 
Modification of Dose of Chemotherapy – Regimen A, page 87, and 11.3.9. Modification of Dose of 
Chemotherapy – Regimen  B,  page 90,  and  the  respective  criteria  for  dose  modification  should  be 
applied.  
 
12.2. Evaluations at the end of treatment 
For estimation of efficacy of treatment a cranial MRI with and without contrast injection should 
be performed about 6 weeks after the last cycle of maintenance chemotherapy.  
 
Monitoring for therapy associated toxicities should include: 
- Audiology– Pure Tone Audiometry, air conduction if needed combined with tympanogram, 
or bone conduction. 
- Glomerular filtration rate (GFR)  
- Auxiology and endocrinological evaluations  
- Additional  individual  evaluations,  as  due  to  clinical  indication  (thorough clinical  and  full 
neurological examination always necessary) 
 
12.3. Post-treatment Follow-up 
For estimation of efficacy of treatment, cranial MRI with and without contrast injection should 
be performed every 4 months during the first year after treatment, at least every 6 months during the 
second year after treatment, and at least every year until the 5th year after treatment.  
In any case of suspected or proven relapse a complete staging including spinal MRI and possibly also 
CSF cytology should be performed.  
After 5 years after end of treatment, cranial MRI should be performed at clinical indication / suspicion 
of relapse, or according to national practice. (see Table below) 
 
As  disease  and  therapy  related  factors  may  lead  to  chronic,  multi-system late  effects,  long  term 
follow-up through a specalized, multidisciplinary team is mandatory.  
 
A thorough clinical and full neurological examination is the mainstay of patient care and should be 
used for the selection of appropriate additional investigations.  
 
Hearing function should be evaluated at least 2 years and 5 years after diagnosis, as it can worsen 
after the end of treatment. It should always be done by pure tone audiometry (air conduction if needed 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
93 
combined with tympanogram, or bone conduction). The respective grading for trial documentation is 
described in chapter 9.4.2. Audiology, page 72. 
 
Endocrinological function should be evaluated at least once per year. Because of the high prevalence 
of  growth  failure  and/or  GH  insufficiency  at  2  years  after  diagnosis,  and  the  need  to  standardize 
detection  and  treatment  of  any  hormonal  dysfunction,  we  recommend  referral  to  a  paediatric 
endocrinologist or paediatrician with endocrine expertise by 2 years after diagnosis, or in the presence 
of any of the biochemical or auxological criteria below.  
A. Biochemical criteria for endocrine referral:  
 Elevated TSH, and/or low fT4. 
(Thyroxine  treatment  [at  about  100ug/m
2
]  to  maintain  TSH  in  normal  range  and  avoid  its 
 carcinogenicity in the irradiated thyroid gland).  
 Elevated  LH  and  FSH  pre- or  post-pubertally,  +/- low  pubertal  estradiol  or  testosterone 
according to reference for age and sex 
 Confirming growth hormone disturbance (likely at 2-5 years) should be done in an endocrine 
department familiar with the hazards and interpretation of these tests. 
 
B. Auxological criteria for mandatory endocrine referral and investigation: 
 Less than 4cm annual increment in height at any age. 
 Less than 8 cm annual increment in puberty spurt (testes 10-12ml or breast buds) 
 Sustained growth at the expense of weight gain and/or early puberty 
 Early Puberty onset  (breast buds < 9y, female; 4ml testes <10y male) 
 Delayed Pubertal onset (>12 y in female, > 13 y in male) 
 Pubertal Arrest (no pubertal progress, according to Tanner, in one year). 
 Secondary amenorrhoea of > 3 months, or primary amenorrhoea after 13.5 y. 
 
Renal function should be evaluated at least once per year, and should include measurement of GFR 
and tubular function.  
 
Neurocognitive impairments should be evaluated according to local / national standards. For trial 
documentation a set of patient and parent rated questionnaires are to be filled out 2 years, and 5 years 
after diagnosis (i.e. 1 and 4 years after end of therapy), as well as at 18 years of age.  
 
  

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
94 
The following evaluations should be performed for post treatment follow-up 
 
Additional  individual  evaluations should  be  performed  as  due  to  clinical  indication.  Physicians 
should also take into account screening for the possibility of secondary neoplasm (eg thyroid with 
1-2  yearly  TSH),  which  needs  to  be  strictly  documented.  Possible  sub/infertility  should  also  be 
considered, and appropriate opportunitites for reproductive assessment and support should be offered.  
In addition to the medical aspects, assistance of the family through a psychological team and direct 
neuropsychologic diagnostics are highly recommended.  
 
12.4. Documentation of efficacy and Quality of Survival data 
After treatment, information on the disease status of the patient should be documented at least once 
per year. Any disease progress, relapse, death, or secondary neoplasm needs to be documented within 
1 month.  
Note that any death occurring before 30 days after end of treatment will be regarded as SAE, and 
need to be documented immediately (see chapter 13, Serious Adverse Events and Toxicity 
Reporting, page 95) 
Study relevant late effects / Quality of survival data should be evaluated  and documented 2  years, 
and 5 years after diagnosis, and at age 18, as described in chapter 9.4. Study on quality of survival 
(QoS), page 69. 
 
12.5. Transition to Adult Care 
As  this  study  includes  patients  up  to  21  years  at  diagnosis,  a  relevant  number  of  patients  will  be 
transferred to adult care while on post-treatment follow-up. For the evaluation of late effects within 
this  trial  it  is  necessary  to  make  sure  that  the  required  follow-up  investigations  and  the  respective 
documentation are maintained. 
It is recommended that patients are transitioned to specalized, multidisciplinary teams, as some late 
effects may  only  appear  after  many  years  and  once  present  may persist  life-long, with  a need for 
specialized support (e.g. hormone replacement, neurorehabilitation and career advice, second tumour 
awareness, fertility advice, and late relapses). 
To  facilitate  assessments  and  documentation,  a  patient  information  sheet  on  necessary  follow-up 
investigations is provided in the appendix.

13. Serious Adverse Events and Toxicity Reporting 
   
13.1. Toxicity and Toxicity monitoring, Definition of terms  
The NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4 will be used for 
purposes of toxicity grading (see Appendix F – Common Toxicity Criteria).  
 
Adverse event (AE) 
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a medicinal product 
or medical therapy, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE 
can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical therapy, whether or not related 
to the medical therapy. 
In order to monitor the safety of all trial participants throughout their trial participation this definition 
has been extended to include any treatment provided in the trial (e.g. radiotherapy). 
The  legal  definition  does  not  need  extension  to  untoward  medical  occurrences  before  start  of  trial 
treatment, because any procedures at that time are standard procedures for these patients and do not 
subject them to any trial specific additional risk. 
 
Adverse reaction (AR) 
An  adverse  reaction  is  an  AE  which  is  usually  judged  by  the  responsible  physician  as  having  a 
reasonable suspected causal relationship to an investigational medicinal product administered in any 
dose. The definition covers also medication errors and uses outside what is foreseen in the protocol. 
The definition  implies  a  reasonable  possibility  of  a  causal  relationship  between  the  event  and  the 
investigational medicinal product. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest 
a causal relationship.  
‘No  reasonable  possibility’  means that  firstly  the  time  relationship  to  drug  administration  is 
improbable (with the knowledge at the time), and/or another explanation is more likely. 
 
Unexpected Adverse Reaction (UAR) 
An unexpected adverse reaction is an AR the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the 
applicable drug information. Reports which add significant information on the specificity, increase 
of  occurrence,  or  severity  of  a  known,  already  documented  serious  adverse  reaction  constitute 
unexpected reactions. Examples of UARs: 
- Unexpected outcome (e.g. fatal) of an expected AR 
- Increase in the rate of occurrence of an expected AR, which is judged to be clinically important, is 
considered as unexpected 
- New report of more specific disease (e.g. interstitial nephritis) instead of a labelled, more general 
AR (such as acute renal failure) 
 
Serious adverse event (SAE) or reaction (SAR) 
A serious adverse event (SAE) or serious adverse reaction (SAR) is any untoward medical occurrence 
or effect that at any dose (see chapter 13.2.): 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening 
 Reqires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) 
A SUSAR is every suspected adverse reaction which is both unexpected and serious.

13.2. Serious Adverse Events Requiring Immediate Reporting on SAE Form 
Any of the following AEs occurring after the first day of protocol defined treatment must be 
reported, as long as no exception criterion for immediate SAE reporting according to 13.3 is 
met. 
From  30  days  after  end  of  trial  treatment  throughout  the  follow-up  period  SAEs  only  have  to  be 
immediately reported on the SAE form as long as the investigator suspects a causal relationship of 
the SAE to the protocol defined treatment. 
 
- AE which results in death: 
Death  is  an  outcome  of  an  AE  and  must  be  reported  together  with  the  cause  of  death  on  the  SAE 
form.  Note  that every  death  occurring  from  first  day  of  treatment  until 30  days  after  end  of 
treatment has to be reported on a SAE form irrespective of the cause of death. Later than 30 days 
after end  of trial treatment death has only to be  reported on SAE  form, as long as the investigator 
suspects a causal relationship to the protocol defined treatment. 
 
- AE which is life-threatening: 
The term “life-threatening” refers to an event where the patient is at immediate risk of death at the 
time of the event (e.g. requires immediate intensive care treatment). It does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might cause death if it were more severe. 
Note that haematological toxicity (CTCAE Grade IV) is expected, and not to be immediately reported 
as an SAE, although life threatening. All other CTCAE Grade IV toxicities need to be immediately 
reported as SAE. 
 
- AE requiring hospitalisation or AE requiring prolongation of hospitalisation:  
Hospitalisation is defined as at least one overnight admission.  
 
Hospitalisation  without  underlying  adverse  event  is  not  an  SAE  and  hence  does  not  require  SAE 
reporting. Examples are: 
 Hospitalisation for protocol procedures, e.g. chemotherapy or radiotherapy  
 Elective hospitalisation for a pre-existing condition that has not worsened  
 Admission to a rehabilitation centre or hospice 
 Hospitalisation for social reasons (e.g. due to anxiety but otherwise treatable on an outpatient 
basis) 
 
Expected side effects of chemotherapy which are listed in the drug information will not be reported 
immediately on an SAE form unless in the opinion of the responsible physician they unexpectedly 
prolonged the hospitalisation or required intensive care therapy.  
 
Hospitalisation due to signs and symptoms associated with disease progression are only considered 
immediately reportable as SAE when outcome leads to death during protocol treatment and for 30 
days after the last protocol therapy. (see definitions of exeptions to SAE reporting in 13.3.) 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
97 
 
- AE or AR resulting in persistent or significant disability or incapacity: 
Disability is defined as a substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions 
e.g. persistent blindness, deafness. 
 
-A congenital anomaly or birth defect 
Pregnancy and its outcome should be reported on an SAE form in order to identify and follow up on 
outcome  of  pregnancy  and  on  any  congenital  abnormalities,  also  births  from  fathers  under 
chemotherapy are to be reported on the SAE form. However, pregnancy itself is per definition not 
serious.  
 
- Other medically important conditions 
Medical  judgement  should  be  exercised  in  deciding  whether  an  AE  is  serious  in  other  situations. 
Important AEs that are in the opinion of the investigator clinically unexpected and not immediately 
life-threatening  or  do  not  result  in  death  or  hospitalisation  but  may  jeopardise  the  subject  or  may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above, should also 
be considered serious and are reportable on an SAE form. 
 
 
13.3. Protocol-Specific Exceptions to immediate SAE Reporting 
The  use  of  all  investigational  drugs  is  current  standard  of  care  for paediatric patients  with 
medulloblastoma,(Kortmann, Kuhl et al. 2000; Taylor, Bailey et al. 2003; Packer, Gajjar et al. 2006; 
Jakacki, Burger et al. 2012 Lannering, Rutkowski et al. 2012) (see also introduction section) and the 
design  of  the  two  study  arms  is  experimental  only  regarding  to  the  treatment  schedule  and  the 
cumulative dosing and not in respect of the use of the substances. The safety profile of these drugs is 
well  established.  Exceptions  to  immediate  SAE  reporting  obligations  for  certain  expected  or 
anticipated events therefore do not compromise patients' safety.  
 
All  SAE  which  do  not  require  immediate  reporting  will  be  documented  on the  electronic  or  paper 
CRF forms. This applies from first day of trial treatment until end of the follow-up period defined by 
the  protocol.  The  investigators’ SAE reporting obligations to the sponsor are thereby fulfilled. All 
SAE, including those not requiring immediate reporting, are regularly seen by the Data Monitoring 
and Safety Committee. 
 
The following SAE do not require immediate reporting on the SAE form: 
- Expected  hospitalisation  for  procedures  such  as  blood  transfusion  for  haematological  toxicity 
CTCAE°1-4  without  complications,  antibiotic  treatment  of  neutropenic  fever  or  CTCAE°1-3 
infections, nutritional support for weight loss CTCAE°1-3 or other expected toxicity CTCAE°1-3 
(e.g.  bleeding  or  haematuria  due  to  thrombopenia)  is  not  to  be  immediately  reported  on  an  SAE 
form. It will be documented on the respective therapy / toxicity CRF. 
- SAE that occur within the follow-up period defined by the protocol, but later than 30 days after end 
of trial treatment, and for which the investigator does not suspect a causal relationship to the protocol 
defined treatment is not to be immediately reported on an SAE form. It will be documented on the 
respective follow-up CRF. 
- Hospitalisation due to signs and symptoms of disease progression as long as the outcome does not 
lead  to  death  during  protocol  treatment  and  for  30  days  after  last  protocol  therapy  is  not  to  be 
immediately  reported  on  an  SAE  form.  It will  be  documented  on  the  respective  CRF  for 
documentation of relapse / progression. 
 
 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17

13.4. Serious Adverse Event Reporting, Assessment and Regulatory Requirements 
The investigator is responsible for reporting to the sponsor all SAEs in relation to subjects treated by 
him in the clinical trial from first day of protocol defined treatment until end of the follow-up phase 
as defined by the protocol. The investigator does not need to actively monitor subjects for adverse 
events once the trial has ended. 
 
The investigator has to report any SAE requiring immediate reporting (see 13.2) within 24 hours after 
knowledge by fax on the SAE form to the Safety Desk, Münster, Germany. Personal data have to be 
replaced by the MARVIN ID before forwarding any information.  
 
Safety Desk Contact: 
University Hospital Münster 
Centre for Clinical Trials (ZKS) Münster 
Von-Esmarch-Str. 62 
48129 Münster 
Germany 
Phone: +49 (0)251 83 57109 
Fax: +49 (0)251 83 57112 
Email: mssd@ukmuenster.de 
 
The local investigator is responsible for the assessment of seriousness, and relatedness of the SAE 
to the medical therapy defined in the protocol, and/ or concomitant therapy. The SAE form should be 
completed  with  as  much  information  as  possible.  Where  possible,  a  diagnosis  rather  than  a  list  of 
symptoms should be given. The local investigator should not wait for full details before making the 
initial  report.  This  should  include  at  least  the  following  information: MARVIN ID,  description  of 
SAE, seriousness criterion, details about medical therapy, causality assessment, current outcome, and 
identification  of  reporting  investigator.  SAEs  must  be  followed  up  until  the  condition  resolves  or 
stabilises. Any follow-up information should be reported as soon as possible. The investigator should 
answer queries concerning an SAE as soon as possible. 
 
The causal relationship to the medical therapy should be judged as follows: 
- Reasonable possibility = there are facts or arguments to suggest a causal relationship (e.g. a clear or 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug). 
- No reasonable possibility = clinical event and/or lab abnormality, with an improbable time sequence 
to drug administration and/or in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide plausible 
explanation. 
 
The Safety Desk will document each SAE, check it and query additionally required information. The 
Safety Desk will immediately inform the Coordinating Investigator. He will reassess the relatedness 
of the event. He will also assess whether an SAR is expected or unexpected (SUSAR) according to 
the reference safety information, which is included in the selected Summary of Product Informations 
for the investigational medicinal products as in the appendix to the protocol. Relevant version is the 
version at the time of occurance of the SAE.  
The coordinating investigator will also assess whether an SAE might influence the benefit-risk-ration 
or might require changes in the conduct of the trial. 
 
Note,  that  neither  a  national  trial  coordinator  nor  the  Coordinating  Investigator  and/or  the  sponsor 
can downgrade a local investigator’s causality assessment. If the Coordinating Investigator disagrees 
that  the  event  is  related  to  the  drug,  clarification  may  be  sought  from  the  local  investigator.  If  the 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
99 
international coordinator still disagrees both opinions must be provided with the report. However, up-
grading is possible. 
 
In case of a SUSAR the Coordinating  Investigator together with the Safety Desk is  responsible to 
inform – by submitting an expedited report  a.s.a.p. - the national  competent authorities, the Ethics 
Committees, the respective legal EU authorities, the DMSC and the National Coordinators within the 
time limits specified by law and in accordance with local requirements. These time limits are:  
- 7 days in case of death or life-threatening SUSAR, and  
- 15 days otherwise.  
The  National  Trial  Coordinators  are  responsible  for  informing  all  investigators  in  their countries 
according to local legal requirements. They are also responsible for providing any support in SUSAR 
or other safety submissions to their national competent authority or Ethics Committee according to 
local requirements. 
 
In case of SAE or SAR (not SUSAR), the case will be recorded and included within the annual safety 
/ toxicity reports.  
 
The Coordinating Investigator is responsible for the ongoing safety evaluation of the trial. The Safety 
Desk will inform him immediately about any relevant safety information coming to its knowledge as 
will the Coordinating Investigator inform the Safety Desk. In case of safety relevant issues (besides 
SUSAR)  which  require  immediate  reporting,  the  Safety  Desk  will  support  the  Coordinating 
Investigator to submit an appropriate report in due time. This includes issues which might materially 
alter  the  current  benefit-risk  assessment  of  an  investigational  medicinal  product  or  that  would  be 
sufficient  to  consider  changes  in  the  investigational  medicinal  products  administration  or  in  the 
overall  conduct  of  the  trial  as  well  as  urgent  safety  measures  to  protect  the  subjects  against  any 
immediate hazard. 
 
Annual safety report 
According  to  the  legal  requirements,  annual  safety  reports  (Development  Safety  Update  Reports, 
DSUR) will be prepared and submitted. The Coordinating Investigator is responsible for providing 
the  updated  benefit-risk  assessment  of  the  trial  for  the  Annual  Safety  Report  (passages  requiring 
medical assessment) and for the accuracy of the report. The Coordinating Data Centre is responsible 
for supplying information from the central database. The Safety Desk is responsible for preparing the 
template, adding the other parts of the annual safety report, finalizing it and distributing it the National 
Trial Coordinators for submission in a timely manner.  
An annual safety report of all study groups will be included in the annual report to the independent 
Data  Monitoring and Safety Committee  (DMSC).  If  the  DMSC  have  any  concerns  regarding  the 
safety of patients, they will report these concerns to the PNET 5 MB study coordinator, respectively.  
 
 
13.5. Adverse Event Documentation 
All AEs as required for endpoint analyses are to be reported after the respective treatment element on 
the paper or electronic toxicity CRF. 
All immediately reportable SAE are to be reported on the SAE form  
All SAE which are exempted from immediate reporting are to be documented on the respective CRFs 
as described in chapter 13.3..This applies from first day of trial treatment until end of the follow-up 
period defined by the protocol.  The investigators’ SAE reporting obligations  to  the sponsor are 
thereby fulfilled.

14. Data Management  
 
14.1. Data Collection 
In PNET 5 MB, data will be captured by a certified Remote Data Entry (RDE) system, e.g. MARVIN 
software  (Xclinical).  Data  collection  and  management  will  be  done  by  participating  institutions, 
national data centres, and coordinating data centres.  
 
14.1.1. Participating Institutions 
As to national policy, patient data might be documented in the participating institutions directly via 
internet  based  RDE,  or  on  case  record  forms  (CRFs)  which  are  provided  and  put  into  the  RDE 
database by the national data centres.  
Completion  of  the  CRF  /  RDE  files  may  be  delegated  by  the  Investigator  in  each  centre  to  an 
authorised  member  of  the  site  research  team.  In  all  cases,  it  remains  the  responsibility  of  the 
Investigator in each centre to ensure that the CRF /RDE file has been completed correctly and that 
the data recorded are accurate. 
 
14.1.2. National data centres  
Data management will be performed by national group data centre. The responsibilities of the national 
data centres include: 
- Validation of eligibility of patient 
- Registration of patients 
- Randomisations of patients (where appropriate) 
- Shipment of documents required at the trial sites (investigator site file, CRFs, etc.) 
- Providing information on treatment according to protocol 
- According to national policy: Collection of paper CRFs, or data entry in Marvin  
- Clarification of implausible or missing data 
- Relaying queries to the investigators 
 
14.1.3. Coordinating data centre  
The coordinating data centre (CDC) for PNET 5 MB - LR is located at the Institute Curie, France. 
The  coordinating  centre  for PNET  5  MB - SR is  located  at  the  University  Medical  Center  of  the 
University  of  Hamburg  (respective  adressess,  see  chapter 1. Principal  Coordinating  Investigators ,

14.2. Registration of Patients and Patient Identification 
Screening for eligibility: 
Participating  institutions  will  inform  national  data  centres  about the patient, by  fax  using  the 
eligibility screening form. This form contains information about inclusion and exclusion criteria of 
the patient, and the sending of material for mandatory central reference evaluations will be recorded. 
In order to enable the exact calculation of decimal age at first surgery, and verification of inclusion 
criterion a, (age at diagnosis 3-5 years –depending on the country – and less than 22 years) the birth 
date of the patient will be recorded.  
As central national pathology/ biology / and neuroradiology review are prerequisite for inclusion of 
patients, tumour material and MRI need to be sent to the respective national reference institutions. 
Results of these reviews will be reported to the local institution as well as to the national data centre.  
For  sending  of  these  materials  and  matching to  the data  at  the  national  data  centre,  either  a  local 
patient ID or the name of the patient can be used, according to the national policy and laws. In the 
national  groups,  where  patient  names  are  recorded,  the  authorisation  to  record  the  names  will  be 
included in the appropriate informed consent form. If local patient IDs are used, the local investigator 
is obliged to keep a confidential list of patients connecting local patient IDs with the name. 
 
Registration: 
After eligibility of the patient is verified in the national data centre with respect to the results of the 
central review evaluations, a registration fax will be prepared by the national data centre and will be 
sent to the participating institution for confirmation of signing of the requested informed consents, 
and in PNET 5 MB - SR the agreement to randomization. If this is confirmed (via the prepared Fax) 
by the participating institution, the patient will be registered, and in PNET 5 MB - SR be randomized. 
A patient  file  will  be  generated  in  Marvin on  a  screening  platform by  the participating  institution. 
Hereby, a unique patient ID (MARVIN ID) will be generated. Neither names, initials nor birth dates 
will be documented in Marvin. Identification in the international RDE (Marvin) will solely be based 
on  the MARVIN  ID.  Decimal  age  at  first  surgery  will  be  calculated  based  on  the  reported  date  of 
birth,  but  only  the  decimal  age  will  be  recorded  in  Marvin. Eligibility  data  will  be  entered  by  the 
national  data  centre  and  in  the  remote  data  entry  system the eligibility  criteria  will  again  be 
automatically  checked  with  the  input  of  registration  data.  If  all  entered  data  match  the  eligibility 
criteria, patients will be stratified into PNET 5 MB - LR or PNET 5 MB - SR, according to the WNT 
subgroup Status.  If  a  patient  is  stratified  as  a PNET  5  MB - SR patient,  randomisation  will  be 
performed on demand in the RDE system, based on the predefined randomisation lists (see chapter 
10. Study Entry, page 76). 
The result of the stratification / randomisation as well as the MARVIN ID will be reported via Fax 
on the registration form to the participating institution and to the national QoS coordinator. As to the 
policy  of  the  national  group,  further  documentation  will  be  done  by  the  participating  institution 
directly into Marvin, or in written form on the CRFs to the national data centre.

14.3. Collected data 
The master versions (in English) of the case record forms (CRFs) are contained in the appendix. All 
data  will  be  collected  by  remote  data  entry,  and  will  be  put  into  the  internet  based  platform 
https://gpoh-1.xclinical.net either  directly  by  the  partipating  institutions,  or  by  the  national  data 
centres.  The  items  recorded  by  RDE  are  closely  based  on  the  CRFs,  so  that  they  can  be  used 
alternatively for transmission of data. 
 
The following rules for RDE documentation have to be observed: 
• Corrections of data are only possible with the explanation of a reason. An audit trail will record the 
data input and any changes 
• Input of data is only possible for authorized persons who will have been trained in the use of the 
system 
 
The following rules for completing paper CRFs have to be observed: 
• CRFs are to be filled in with a black ballpoint pen. Pens or pencils are not allowed. 
• Script must be clear and legible. 
• Mistakes are to be cancelled by a simple horizontal line and correction is to be written above or next 
to it. The correction has to be signed and dated. 
•  Data  fields  which  cannot  be  completed  due  to  missing  information  have  to  be  marked  and 
commented.

• CRFs have to be completed in a timely fashion and finally checked and signed by the investigator. 
• In case of major corrections and/or missing data, the reason is to be given. 
• All requested data fields should be answered completely; this applies also if there is no major change 
from a previous examination. 
• All primary data (e.g. diagnostic findings) which are lodged in the CRF have to be signed and dated 
by the responsible local investigator. 
 
The following data are regarded as source data: 
- All data contained in the patient's medical records. 
- Pathology/reference pathology. 
- Images. 
- Surgical reports. 
 
PLEASE  NOTE:  If  additionally  to  the  CRF  /  RDE  documentation,  parts  or  the  individual  patient 
record (as e.g. patient reports) are sent to the national data centre, the patient identification on these 
papers must be replaced by the local patient ID where applicable. An exeption is defined, if national 
laws and policy allow the recording of the name of the patient, and the patient has given its explicit 
informed consent on this issue.  
 
14.4. Archiving 
Archiving  and  protection  of  the  RDE  data  will  be  performed  by  XClinical.  Data  exports  will  be 
created for analyses at the national and coordinating data centres. 
The  archiving  of  all  study  relevant  documents  at  the  trial  site,  at  the  trial  offices,  and  at  the 
coordinating investigator's site will be handled according to national law. 
 
 
14.5. Confidentiality and Data Protection 
Individual data of all participating patients, i.e. data regarding the disease, treatment and follow-up 
will  be  collected  in  the  database.  If  it  is  according  to  national  laws,  and  a  patient and/or  his/her 
parents/legal guardian have given informed consent, the patient's name and date of birth may be held 
at the national trial office. This is needed for central treatment planning and in case of direct patient 
contact. The data will be stored separate from the database and handled confidentially. 
All study relevant data will be stored electronically and handled confidentially. For statistical analysis 
and documentation, patients will be identified only by the central patient number. 
The investigators and all members of a trial centre or other persons involved in the trial are obliged 
to  keep  study  data  and  information  confidential  and  to  grant  access  only  to  individuals  who  are 
involved  in  the  study.  An  exception  to  this  rule  applies  only  to  representatives  of  the  sponsor  or 
regulatory authorities.  
All legal requirements concerning safety, confidentiality and prevention of data loss will be respected. 
All involved individuals are sworn to secrecy. All databases will be backed up every day. Access to 
data is strictly limited to authorised persons. Anonymity of data in the scope of biometrical analysis 
is guaranteed.

15. Quality Management 
 
Quality control of primary diagnostic procedures through central reference evaluations are a central 
element of the PNET 5 MB trials and are described in chapter 9. Detailed Guidelines for Radiological, 
Biological, and QoS investigations, page 61. 
 
Quality control of radiotherapy is decribed in chapter 11.2.8. Quality control of radiotherapy, page 
82) 
 
Names and contact data of the respective national reference institutions are given in the appendix B 
– International Contact Details. 
 
Analyses  of  the  trials  will  include  per-protocol  analyses.  Per-protocol  criteria  are  mentioned  in 
chapter Statistical   Considerations   in   PNET   5   MB-LR,   page 104,   and   chapter Statistical 
Considerations in PNET 5 MB-SR, page 105, respectively. 
 
 
16A. Statistical Considerations in PNET 5 MB - LR  
 
Study Analysis - LR 
The primary endpoint is the 3 year-event free survival (EFS) rate, the aim of the study being to achieve 
a 3 year rate in excess of 80%. Any progression, any relapse, any occurrence of second malignancy, 
and any death will be considered as an event. EFS will be calculated from date of first operation. 
The  expected  annual  accrual  in  this  phase  2  study  is  around  10-12  patients.  With  a  duration  of 
inclusion  of  6  years,  60 patients  could  be  included  in  this  study.  Final  evaluation  would  be  then 
possible 9 years after trial initiation. 
 
Results will be analysed according to a modified multistage Fleming procedure, in order to be able 
to stop early the trial only if too many events are observed. Sixty patients are to be included in the 
trial. Three interim analyses, the third one being the final one, will take place when 20, then 40 and 
at last 60 patients will have been included and followed at least 36 months. 
Calculations  of the  boundaries  have  been  performed  assuming  a  36  months  EFS  rate  less  than  or 
equal to 80% as not interesting (null hypothesis) and controlling the power in order to detect in 88% 
of cases a 36 months EFS rate equal or higher than 91% (error risk  of 11.6% of rejecting wrongly 
the new protocol, the true event rate being  91%). The error risk  to wrongly accept the protocol is 
limited to 11.1% (probability of accepting the new protocol with a true EFS rate  80%).  
The first 20 patients included in the study will be analysed when their minimum follow-up will be 36 
months. The stopping rule will be reached if 5 or more than 5 events are observed during those 36 
months (observed EFS rate = 75%). 
If less than 5 events are observed, then a second analysis will be performed when further 20 patients 
have been included and followed at least 36 months. The stopping rule will be reached if 7 or more 
than  7  events  are  observed  during  those  36  months  among  these  40  patients  (observed  EFS  rate  = 
82.5%). 
Once again if less than 7 events are observed, then a third and final analysis will be performed when 
further 20 patients have been included and followed at least 36 months. If 9 or more than 9 events 
have been observed during those 36 months (observed  3 year- EFS ≤ 85%), then we will conclude 
to the inefficacy of the treatment, that is a 3 year EFS equal or lower to 80%. If 8 or less than 8 events 
have been observed (observed 3 year- EFS ≥ 86.7%), then results will be consistent with a 3 year EFS 
superior to 80%. 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
105 
In  the  final analysis,  the  precision  of  the  observed  3-year  event  free  survival  rate  will  be  then 
estimated by calculating the lower limit of the 89% one-sided exact confidence interval.  
When analysing results, if all patients do not have the 36 months required minimum follow-up, then 
the event free survival rate will be estimated by Kaplan-Meier. This estimation will be compared with 
the Fleming lower boundary, in order to conclude if it is equal or lower to the corresponding lower 
rejection boundary,  
The  design  means  that  inclusion  in  the  trial  will  continue  before  the  assessment  of  the  primary 
endpoint  of  the  previous  patients.  It  is  then  anticipated  that  by  the  time  the  first  analysis  will  be 
performed, most of the patients will have been already included in the trial. 
Group  sequential  design  due  to  Fleming  is  regarded  in  the  framework  of  inverse  normal  adaptive 
method. Therefore sample size adjustments are allowed. 
Analyses will be performed according to the intention to treat principle. 
During  the  interim  and  final  analyses,  the  3  year  EFS  rate  will  also  be  estimated  on  per-protocol 
patients for exploratory purposes. Per-protocol patients are defined as the fraction of analysed patients 
fulfilling inclusion and non inclusion criteria and receiving radiotherapy and chemotherapy protocol-
conform, including treatment modifications defined in the protocol. A patient receives radiotherapy 
protocol  conform  if  radiotherapy  starts  within  40  days  post  surgery,  if  treatment  planning  is 
performed via 3D planning system, if dose to CSA is 18.0 Gy, if primary tumour bed dose is 36.0 
Gy, and if completion of radiotherapy treatment is within 50 days. A patient receives maintenance 
chemotherapy  protocol-conform,  if  he  received  3  courses  of  chemotherapy  A  and  3  courses  of 
chemotherapy B (± dose modifications due to toxicities according to defined standard).  
 
Even if exploratory, the results of the the per-protocol analysis will have to be carefully investigated 
by  the  DMSC,  together  with  the  ITT  analysis  for  decision  of  closure  or  continuation  of  the  trial. 
Kaplan Meier estimation of the 3 year EFS, excluding patients who do not fulfil per-protocol criteria, 
will be calculated and compared wih the Fleming lower boundary. In order to take into account the 
delayed  start  of  radiotherapy,  which  can  not  be  checked  as  an  eligibility  criteria  at  the  time  of 
inclusion, but may increase the risk of relapse if longer than 40 days, a particular per-protocol analysis 
excluding only patients for whom this criteria is violated will be performed and considered as very 
important. 
 
Results of the interim analyses will be reviewed by the DMSC; the decision to close or continue the 
trial is essentially a medical one, the statistical stopping rules will be used as a guideline to inform 
this decision.  
 
 
16B. Statistical Considerations in PNET 5 MB - SR 
 
Study Analysis - SR 
The  aim  of  the  study  is  the  comparison  between  radiotherapy  and  8  cycles  of  maintenance 
chemotherapy  with  and  without  concurrent  carboplatin  during  radiotherapy.  Patients  will  be 
randomly  assigned  to  one  of  the  two  therapies.  Inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  are  described  in 
chapter 7. Eligibility, page 55. 
 
This is a multicenter, prospective, non-blinded, two-arm, randomised, controlled clinical study. The 
study  schedule  is  determined  by  the  number  of  events  pooled  over  both  therapy  groups.  The  final 
analysis is intended to be performed after 105 events. An accrual period of 6 years and an additional 
follow-up time of 4 years are expected to observe 105 events. Randomisation will be performed block 
by block. The randomisation will be stratified by residual tumour (defined by central MRI review), 
sex and age group to achieve the following 5 strata: 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17 
106 
Stratum 1: Patients with unequivocal residual tumour (< 1.5cm
2
) (expected: 12%) 
Stratum  2:  Female  patients  without  unequivocal  residual tumour and age ≤ 7 years at diagnosis 
(expected: 9%) 
Stratum  3:  Female  patients  without  unequivocal  residual tumour and  age  >  7  years  at  diagnosis 
(expected: 13%) 
Stratum  4:  Male  patients  without  unequivocal  residual tumour and  age  ≤  7  years  at  diagnosis 
(expected: 26%) 
Stratum  5:  Male  patients  without  unequivocal  residual tumour and  age  >  7  years  at  diagnosis 
(expected: 40%)

The  statistical  analyses  will  be  performed by  the  reference  center  for  biostatistics  (Prof. Dr.  A. 
Faldum, Dr.  R.  Kwiecien, Münster,  Germany).  The  analyses  will  be  performed  according  to  the 
intention-to-treat principle. A per-protocol analysis will be performed for exploratory purposes.  
 
Per-protocol patients  are  defined  as  all  patients  fulfilling  the  inclusion  and exclusion criteria  (see 
chapter 7. Eligibility, page 55), and who received radiotherapy and chemotherapy protocol-conform.  
 
A patient received radiotherapy conforming to protocol if: 
- Radiotherapy was started within 40 days post surgery 
- Treatment planning was performed via 3D planning system 
- Dose to CSA 23.4 Gy 
- Primary tumour bed dose 30.6 Gy 
- Completion of radiotherapy treatment within 50 days  
 
A  patient  received  chemotherapy  with  carboplatin  (concomitant  to  radiotherapy) conforming  to 
protocol, if he/she received all 30 doses.  
 
A patient received maintenance chemotherapy conforming to protocol, if he/she received at least 3 
courses of chemotherapy A and 3 courses of chemotherapy B (± dose modifications due to toxicities 
according to defined standard).  
 
For the analysis of toxicities, all patients who received at least 5 days of radiotherapy will be included.

The  main  question  will  be  tested  according  to  the  intention  to  treat  principle  with  an  overall 
significance  level  of  =  5%.  All  p-values  corresponding  to  the  secondary  questions  and  the  per-
protocol analysis will be regarded as explorative.  
 
Missing Values 
For  the  analysis  of  survival  times,  missing  values  will  be  regarded  as  censored  data.  For  all  other 
analyses, only patients with available data will be included.

16B.5. Interim Analyses and Final Analysis 
Three analyses are intended to be performed to answer the main question, unless the trial is stopped 
prematurely. The trial will be terminated after an interim analysis, if the main question can already 
be answered at this interim analysis. 
 
The criteria for stopping the trial after an interim analysis are  given by the inverse normal method 
corresponding to a 3-step group sequential plan according to Wang & Tsiatis with boundary shape 
parameter of ∆ = 0.37, with the possibility to stop the trial in favour of the alternative hypothesis and 
without the possibility to stop for futility.(Wang and Tsiatis 1987) The bounds of the 3-step group 
sequential  design  result  from  a  two-sided test, α=5%, power=80% and 3-year-EFS
OP
 rates  of  75% 
and 85% for the two groups, a sample size allocation of 1 and an information rate of 1/5 for the first 
and  2/5  for  the  second  interim  analysis.  This  ∆  minimizes  the  average  sample  size  under  the 
alternative hypothesis.  
 
After each interim analysis a data dependent sample size calculation may  be performed. Then, the 
accrual period, the observation time, the schedule of the second interim and final analysis (required 
number of events) and the number of interim analyses can be adapted amongst others. 
 
If the 3-step sequential plan according to Wang and Tsiatis described above will not be changed, the 
first interim analysis will take place after 21 events, the second interim analysis will take place after 
42 events and the final analysis will take place after 105 events.  
 
The numbers of events of both therapy arms are added up to evaluate the number of occurred events.  
 
16B.6. Sample Size Calculation 
Aim of the trial is to investigate the additional administration of carboplatin during radiotherapy. The 
3-year EFS
OP
 for patients with standard therapy is assumed to be 75%, the 3-year EFS
OP
 for patients 
with additional carboplatin during radiotherapy is assumed to be 10% higher, i.e. 85%. We assume 
exponential EFS
OP
-times and a Weibull-distributed drop-out-rate in both groups with a drop-out-rate 
of 5% after 3  years and a shape parameter of γ = 2.4113 (assumptions according to the data of the 
previous trial PNET 4). With a significance level of 5%, an accrual rate of 6 years and a follow-up 
period of 4 years 299 patients will be needed to observe 105 events in both therapy arms and to obtain 
a power of 80% with a 3-step group sequential design according to Wang and Tsiatis with boundary 
shape parameter of ∆ = 0.37 when using the log-rank test. This corresponds to an accrual rate of 50 
patients per year. The number of events was calculated with ADDPLAN 4.0.

16B.7. Stopping rules for Ototoxicities and Death 
A comparison of the distributions of grade-III and -IV ototoxicities and treatment associated death 
between the two therapy arms will be performed with a one-sided Fisher’s exact test. A 4-step group 
sequential design according to Pocock has been chosen.  
 
Ototoxicity will be graded according to Chang criteria. 
Treatment associated death is defined as any death which occurs while the patient receives therapy, 
until 1 month after therapy. 
 
Analyses will be performed after 2, 3, 4 and 5 years unless the study was stopped before.  
 
With an accrual period of 6 years, a follow-up period of 3 years, an accrual rate of 50 patients per 
year, an ototoxicity rate of 12% for patients with standard therapy, a sample size allocation of 1 and 
an overall significance level of 5% we will obtain a power of  
 
a) 15% if the ototoxicity and treatment associated death rate in the experimental arm is 15% 
b) 47% if the ototoxicity and treatment associated death rate in the experimental arm is 20% 
c) 79% if the ototoxicity and treatment associated death rate in the experimental arm is 25% 
d) 95% if the ototoxicity and treatment associated death rate in the experimental arm is 30% 
 
If one of the interim analyses shows a significant difference in the rates of ototoxicities and treatment 
associated  death  between  the  two  therapy  arms,  the  DMSC  will  be  informed.  They  will  decide 
whether the study will be stopped due to ototoxicities.  
 
STOPPING RULES FOR DEATH 
A comparison of the distributions of overall survival between both therapy arms will be done with a 
two-sided  log-rank  test.  A  3-step  group  sequential  design  according  to  Wang  and  Tsiatis  has  been 
chosen with boundary shape parameter of ∆ = 0.28. 
 
Analyses will be performed after 10, 15 and 20 events occurred unless the trial was stopped before.  
 
With a two-sided test, α=10%, an accrual period of 5 years with no further follow-up, an accrual rate 
of 50 patients per year, a 5-year-OS
OP
 rate of 92% in the standard arm (estimated according to PNET 
4), a sample size allocation of 1 and an information rate of 1/2 for the first and 3/4 for the second 
interim analysis, we will have a power of: 
 
a. 59%  if  the  5-year  OS
OP
 rate  in  the  experimental  arm  is  82%  (10%  lower  than  the  standard 
arm) 
b. 79%  if  the  5-year  OS
OP
 rate  in  the  experimental  arm  is  77%  (15%  lower  than  the  standard 
arm) 
c. 91%  if  the  5-year  OS
OP
 rate  in  the  experimental  arm  is  72%  (20%  lower  than  the  standard 
arm) 
 
If  one  of  the  interim  analyses  shows  a  significant  difference  in  the  distribution  of  overall  survival 
between the two therapy arms the DMSC will be informed. They will decide whether the trial will be 
stopped due to overall survival.

16B.8. Modifications to the Statistical Design 
The  design  of  the  study  may  be  changed,  if  necessary,  in  the  event  of  important  new  discoveries. 
Modifications  to  the  protocol  will  be  made  only  in  form  of  written  amendments  and  with  the 
agreement of the Study Committee. The respective Ethic Committees have to be informed about the 
modifications.  The  patient  information  has  to  be  changed  according  to  the  modifications  of  the 
protocol. 
 
If  an  adaptation  of  the  adaptive  group  sequential  design  is  necessary – e.g.  because  of  a  low 
recruitment  rate – the  respective  changes  of  the  time  points,  number  of  interim  analyses,  maximal 
sample  size  and  α-spending  function  may  be  done  according  to  the  conditional  rejection  error 
probability method by Schäfer and Müller.(Schäfer and Müller 2001) The modifications can be done 
during a planned or unplanned interim analysis on the basis of the observed data collected so far. The 
corresponding conditional rejection error probability functions are defined by Schäfer.(Schäfer and 
Müller 2001) If a design change is made the time point, the data file of the trial, all calculations and 
the description of the new group sequential design have to be recorded in the amendment. 
 
 
17. Study Duration and End of Study  
 
17A Study Duration PNET 5 MB - LR

Reference Laboratories 
Purpose and scope, applications 
 
Sample Registration:  
 
As part of the PNET 5 MB - LR and PNET 5 MB - SR clinical trials, it will be necessary for 
tissue samples from patients diagnosed with medulloblastoma to undergo central pathological 
review and have the biological status of prognostic molecular markers (MYC, MYCN, ß-catenin 
IHC and mutation (mandatory) and chromosome 6 monosomy (optional)) established prior to 
starting adjuvant therapy, i.e. less than 22 days post-surgery. This will be achieved by treatment 
centres  consenting  patients  for  participation  in  the  study  using  standard  procedures  and 
despatching  frozen  and  paraffin  tumour  tissue to  the  national  reference  laboratory  for 
preparation and assessment.  
 
Pathology  departments  and  national  reference  laboratories  will  play  the  central  role  in 
coordinating  central  pathology  review  and  molecular  diagnostics,  to  allow  stratification  of 
patients with medulloblastoma onto PNET 5 MB and its respective treatment arms. 
 
The  clinical  trial  requires  mandatory  submission  of  the  following  once  a  local  diagnosis  of 
medulloblastoma has been made: 
 
 Confirmation of consent for study 
 Notification of case to national reference centre and submission of: 
 1 x FFPE block - representative of the pathological process 
 1 aliquot of frozen tissue  
 Copy of the local treatment centre pathology report 
 
     
The national reference laboratory will be responsible for sample preparation to achieve central 
pathology  review,  molecular  diagnostics  and  immunohistochemistry,  including  beta-catenin 
staining. Submission  of  frozen  tissue  is  mandatory.  At  least  10mm3  is  desirable;  however 
any amount will be accepted to allow inclusion. 
 
In  addition  to  the  technical  procedures  described  here,  administration  and  recording  of  the 
outcomes for every sample received will be logged into the central trial database (Marvin).

Central Pathology Review and Immunohistochemistry 
 
Neuropathological  central  review  is  undertaken  according  to  the  World  Health  Organisation 
(WHO) Classification 2007. This will include examination of standard haematoxylin and eosin 
(H&E)  and  reticulin  silver  staining  preparations  as  well  as  immunohistochemistry  to  look  at 
factors   such   as   expression   of   neuroepithelial   protein   markers   for   example,   GFAP, 
synaptophysin  and  neurofilament  protein,  as  well  as  proteins  that  may  be  expressed  in  other 
tumours of the posterior fossa, e.g. EMA (epithelial membrane antigen), cytokeratins, LIN28 
and INI-1 in atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumours to aid in confirming the local centre diagnosis.  
 
As    part    of    the    molecular    diagnostic    component    of    the    study,    beta-catenin 
immunohistochemistry will also be assessed.  
 
Once tissue is received by the national reference centre, it will be logged and receipt confirmed 
to the local study centre.  
 
The detailed procedures of sample preparation involved are described later. The following will 
be  prepared  from  the  FFPE  and  frozen  tissue  at  all  national  reference  laboratories  to  aid  up-
front  central  pathology  review  and  biological  analysis  as  well  as  subsequent  investigative 
biological studies: 
 
FFPE - *up  to 20  x  5μm sections  for  central  pathology  review  purposes,  including 
haematoxylin  and  eosin  staining  and  immunohistochemistry  panel – GFAP,  synaptophysin, 
NFP, EMA, INI-1, vimentin, Ki-67 and reticulin special stain.  
*2 x 5μm sections for beta-catenin immunohistochemistry staining.  
1  x  5  μm haematoxylin  and  eosin  stained  section  for  TMA mark-up  by  the  reviewing 
pathologist. 
Frozen -  *1  x  7μm section  for  H&E – to  be  sent  along  with  FFPE  stained  slides  to 
reviewing pathologist for assessment of cell content. 
*10  x  (minimum  of  4  x) touch  preparations  for  FISH MYC and MYCN (mandatory) and 
chromosome 6 (optional) status assessment.  
 
*To be retained at the national reference centre for review and quality control purposes. 
 
The  remaining  FFPE  block  will  be  forwarded  to  the  international  reference  centre,  for 
preparation  of  tissue  microarray  and  processing  for  trials  biological  studies  (see  separate 
international reference centre SOP).   The FFPE block will be returned to the local centre via. 
the national reference centre. 
 
The  amount  of  tissue  submitted  may  affect  the  amount  of  tissue  processing  that  can  be 
undertaken,  however sufficient  tissue  will  always  be  left  in  any  FFPE  blocks  for  further 
diagnostic use, if requested by the local centre.  
 
The remaining frozen material will be stored and made available for subsequent approved trials 
biological studies.

Fluorescence in situ hybridisation 
 
Fluorescence in  situ hybridisation  will  be  undertaken  to  establish  the MYC and MYCN gene 
amplification and monosomy 6 (optional) status of the sample.  
 
Further methods for determination of MYC and MYCN gene amplification and monosomy 
6 status 
 
These may also be determined using validated array-based copy number analyses. 
 
Central  pathology  review  and  molecular  diagnostic  outcomes  will  be  notified  to  the  local 
clinical study centre and the trial coordinating centre.  If there are any discrepancies between 
the local and reviewing pathologist’s diagnosis, they will liaise to reach a consensus. 
 
 
PROCEDURES IN DETAIL 
 
1. Local treatment centres 
 
Collection 
 
When  surgery  is  planned  for  a  paediatric  cerebellar  tumour,  tissue  must be sent  fresh  to  the 
pathology department. The pathologist will prepare tissue for usual diagnosis, ensuring at least 
1 aliquot is retained for frozen storage. Tissue should be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen at the 
earliest opportunity from receipt into the lab. The frozen tissue is stored at -80°C or in liquid 
nitrogen,  until  ready  for  despatch  to  the  national  reference  centre.  The  approximate  time 
between surgical resection and tissue freezing should be recorded. FFPE blocks are prepared as 
per local centre SOPs, with one representative FFPE block used in the diagnostic process being 
submitted to the national reference  centre once a  diagnosis of medulloblastoma is confirmed 
locally, and the patient is consented for trial.   
 
Consent 
 
Once  the  pathologist  has  confirmed  the  tumour  is  medulloblastoma,  it  is  the  local  centre's 
responsibility to undertake consent procedures as per their national SOPs to allow participation 
in  the  clinical  trials,  and  to  permit  investigative  biological  studies  to  be  undertaken  on  the 
material  on  a  link-anonymised  basis.  These  consents  should  include  permission  to  use  other 
materials (e.g. blood, cerebrospinal fluid samples; see separate blood and CSF collection SOPs) 
taken in investigative biological studies.  Consent must be obtained early by the clinical team 
to allow rapid trial inclusion and submission of tissue to national reference centres.  
 
Despatch 
 
The local centre will contact the national reference laboratory immediately once consent and 
medulloblastoma diagnosis is confirmed. The local and national centres will liaise to arrange 
rapid submission to the national reference centre of the frozen and FFPE tissue, a copy of the 
local  pathology  report  and  relevant  documentation  for  transport, under  national  operating 
arrangements.  Receipt  of  material  will  be  confirmed  by  the  national  laboratory,  and  FFPE 
blocks will be returned to local centres in a timely manner.

2. National reference centres 
 
Receipt and received condition of tissue for study will be confirmed to the despatching local 
centre, logged and prepared as below by the national reference laboratory: 
 
Frozen Tissue Preparation 
 
Frozen tissue received will be stored at -80ºC at all time.  Frozen samples will be prepared for 
fluorescence in  situ hybridisation  and  the  production  of  a  haematoxylin  and  eosin  stained 
section to be sent for assessment alongside FFPE material for central pathology review.  
 
Tissue  received  from  centres  will  be  checked  to  ensure  the  patient  name/study  number 
transcribed onto the tube matches the paperwork. 
 
1. The frozen tissue will be prepared for sectioning on the cryostat. 
2. 1 x 4-7μm section will be cut and transferred to a superfrost microscope slide, fixed in 
alcohol and haematoxylin and eosin stained as per local methodologies. 
3. Touch preparations will be made by placing a superfrost slide on the surface of the tissue 
and taking two to three touch preps per sample on 4-8 separate superfrost slides.  
4.  Slides will be fixed in 3:1 methanol to acetic acid and submitted for FISH assessment  
6. The remaining frozen tissue will be stored at -80ºC in cryotubes for subsequent use in 
approved biological studies. 
 
If multiple pieces of frozen tumour are received, each piece must be individually checked for 
composition by frozen section and H&E staining, with the help of an experienced pathologist 
/ neuropathologist, to exclude necrotic or normal tissue contamination. 
 
Optional:  In countries where touch preparations are prepared for iFISH at the local treatment 
centre,  these  may  be  shipped  to  the  national  reference  centre  alongside  the  other  required 
materials, using established national shipping arrangements.  At least 10 slides, 5-6 touches 
each, preferably from two individual tumour pieces, are required. Tumour cell content should 
be assessed in all tumour pieces used. 
 
 
FFPE Tissue Preparation 
 
The  paraffin  block  should  at  all  times  have  sufficient  tissue  remaining  to  allow  for  further 
diagnosis if required by the local centre, therefore consideration for this should be given when 
preparing tissue required for the study.  
 
To allow for central pathology review, up to 20 x 5μm sections are cut on the microtome and 
placed onto superfrost slides. Two slides will be stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E), 
another  with  a  reticulin  silver  stain  and  the  remaining  spare  sections  will  be  available  for 
immunohistochemistry required by the reviewing pathologist, which may include a basic panel 
of  GFAP,  synaptophysin,  NFP, EMA, LIN28, INI-1  and  Ki-67,  leaving  additional  slides  if 
required, to aid central pathology review.  
Beta-catenin status will be assessed by immunohistochemistry. 
The  H&E  stained  frozen  section,  paraffin  section,  IHC  panel  and  beta-catenin  stained  slides 
will  be  issued  along  with  a  copy  of  the  local  centre  pathology  report  to  the  reviewing 
pathologist. These will be retained by the national reference centre for future review and quality 
control purposes.

Appendix D 
 
7 
If  any  additional  immunohistochemistry  to  the  standard  panel  is  required,  the  reviewing 
pathologist will request this and it will be prepared urgently and despatched.  
One of the FFPE H & E sections will be marked up by the review pathologist, to indicate regions 
of exclusive tumour cell content which are representative of the entire sample, in preparation 
for tissue micro-array construction by the international reference laboratory. A maximum of 5x 
1mm diameter cores will be taken depending on tissue availability. (See international reference 
laboratory SOP) 
Where  tissue  permits,  all  FFPE  blocks  will  be  submitted  to  the  international  reference 
laboratory  to  undergo  tissue  microarray  construction  and  further  processing  for  biological 
study.  To  allow  this,  the  national  reference  laboratory  will  send  the  FFPE  block  and 
corresponding H&E slide with tumour areas marked up for coring (see 5) to the international 
reference  laboratory.  The  FFPE  blocks  will  be  returned  to  the  national  laboratories  within  6 
weeks.  The  marked-up  H&E  will  be  retained  by  the  international reference  laboratory. (See 
international reference laboratory SOP) 
The paraffin block will be returned to the local centre once all of the results have been confirmed 
and the block returned by the international reference laboratory.  
 
Immunohistochemistry 
 
Immunohistochemistry will be undertaken as per the national reference laboratory procedures. 
Beta-catenin  antibody  will  be  used  for  staining  by  the  method  of  the  individual  national 
laboratories; however all will use the same primary antibody: 
 
BD transduction laboratories beta-catenin (clone 14), catalogue number 610154 
 
A sample is classified positive for beta-catenin when >10% of nuclei in the tissue section show 
nuclear positive accumulation.  
 
In  tumours  with  borderline  positivity  (i.e.  3%  to  15% positive  cells),  repeat  staining  of  the 
sample is strongly recommended. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CTNNB1 sequencing 
 
CTNNB1 (Gene ID: 1499; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1499) sequencing is required for 
trial entry (see above): 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2: Immunohistochemistry using a beta-catenin 
primary antiserum allows the reaction to be visualised in 
tissue sections. If nuclear staining is present, the sample is 
positive for the WNT/WG pathway activation.  The sample 
shown is positive in approximately 30% of cells.

DNA and RNA will be extracted from fresh-frozen samples according to standard procedures 
(see separate DNA and RNA extraction SOP). Up to 50ng DNA should be sufficient for PCR 
amplification, in order to preserve DNA for further analyses.  
 
PCR  products  will  span  the  mutation cluster  region  in  exon  3  of CTNNB1, encompassing 
sequences encoding amino acids 30 to 45.  The design of the primers must lead to amplimers 
that   cover   nucleotides   791-1070   of   Genbank   reference   sequence   X89579.   Example 
oligonuceotide sequences for the amplification of this region may be found in: 
 
Patricia Legoix et al. Beta-catenin mutations in hepatocellular carcinoma correlate with a low 
rate  of  loss  of  heterozygosity,  Oncogene,  1999,  18:4044:4046. Koch  A,  et  al.,  Childhood 
hepatoblastomas frequently carry a mutated degradation targeting box of the beta-catenin gene. 
Cancer Res. 1999; 59:269-73. 
 
Mutations  will  be  searched  for  using  the  Sanger  direct  DNA  sequencing  method  on  purified 
PCR-products.  Sequence  variants  from  the  reference  normal  sequence  ((Genbank  reference 
sequence X89579)) must be confirmed independently on sequence analysis in both forward and 
reverse directions.  
 
Variants (at the nucleotide and amino acid level) should be recorded and referenced according 
to the international nomenclature (http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/). 
 
Positive results are those cases displaying confirmed non-synonymous missense mutations in 
the mutation cluster region. 
 
 
 
Fluorescence in situ hybridisation 
 
Interphase FISH will be carried out using commercial FISH probes to assess copy numbers of 
MYC and MYCN in relation to centromeric reference probes (both tests are mandatory), and to 
assess monosomy 6 status (optional test): 
 
Probes recommended: 
 
Abbott (Patho Vision) LSI MYCN SpectrumGreen DNA probe (Cat no. 32-191014) 
Kreatech MYCN probe Cat. No. KBI-10106  
(or other commercial locus-specific probe) 
 
Abbott (Patho Vision) LSI c-MYC SpectrumOrange DNA probe (Cat no. 32-190006) 
Kreatech c-MYC probe Cat. No. KBI-10706  
(or other commercial locus-specific probe) 
 
Chromosome 2 centrometic reference probe  (for use with MYC-N probe) 
e.g. Abbott (Patho Vision) CEP 2 SpectrumOrange DNA probe (Cat no. 32-191014) 
 
Chromosome 8 centromeric reference probe (for use with c-MYC probe) 
e.g. Abbott (Patho Vision) CEP SpectrumGreen DNA probe (32-132008) 
 
Metasystems Chromosome 6 XL 6q21 / 6q23 dual probe (Order no. D-5039-100-OG) 
(or other commercial locus-specific probes. Note two loci must be assessed)

Analysis: 
Following sample preparation and undertaking FISH of MYC and MYCN on medulloblastoma  
samples, they will be assessed to determine their amplification status.  
 
The images below illustrate an example of a medulloblastoma sample nucleus with a MYCN 
amplification (a), in contrast to a non-amplified sample (b). (Courtesy of Rachel Newby, NHS 
Northern Genetics Service, Newcastle). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a. MYCN amplification    b. MYCN non-amplified 
 
 
200 nuclei are counted and MYC or MYCN amplification-positive cases are determined as those 
with ≥5% of nuclei showing evidence of gene amplification (signals consistent with double 
minute or homogenously staining region formation, and test probe copy number ≥ 4 times copy 
number  of  the  reference  signal)  See  Ryan  SL  et  al.  (2012)  MYC  family  amplification  and 
clinical   risk-factors   interact   to   predict   an   extremely   poor   prognosis   in   childhood 
medulloblastoma. Acta Neuropathol. 123: 501-13. 
 
For monosomy 6 status, 200 nuclei are counted and positive cases are determined as those with 
≥50% of nuclei showing a single signal for both the p- and q-arm probes (i.e. 1:1). 
 
Recording of FISH data 
Representative images should be saved for all FISH investigations, sufficient to allow results 
to be reviewed by other national reference laboratories. 
 
Determination of MYC and MYCN amplification and monosomy 6 status by array-based copy 
number analysis. 
 
DNA and RNA will be extracted from fresh-frozen samples according to standard procedures 
(see separate DNA and RNA extraction SOP). Samples must contain at least 60% tumour cells.

Recommendations for array-based copy number analysis 
Array-CGH,  SNP  array,  and  other  array-based  copy  number  platforms,  are  sensitive  to 
contamination by DNA of normal cells. To use these techniques, a sample with a minimum of 
60% of tumoural cells is required to obtain good results. In tumour samples containing less than 
60%  of  tumour  cells  (samples  from  primary  tumours  with  extensive  necrotic,  haemorrhagic 
and/or calcification areas), MYC or MYCN status must be assessed by FISH.  
 
Copy number must be assessed using a validated commercial platform, or prepared slides, by 
an  accredited  genomics  reference  laboratory.  The  array  should  contain  DNA  sequences 
(BAC/PAC clones, oligonucleotide sequences, SNPs, etc.) distributed evenly along the whole 
genome. Chromosomal regions of special interest in medulloblastoma, such as chromosomes 
6, 9q or 17q, may be covered more densely; MYC or MYCN loci should each be covered by at 
least several probes, and the close neighbouring regions (within 1Mb either side of the locus) 
should be covered densely.  
 
The presence of replicate probes for specific DNA sequences, on the array, allow for calculation 
of a mean for a given locus, rendering results more robust. 
 
For  comparative  hybridisation  methods,  tumour  DNA  is  analysed  with  an  equal  amount  of 
normal  reference  DNA,  quality  and quantity  checked,  digested,  purified  and  labelled  with 
distinct fluorochromes. Following precipitation and denaturing, the samples are hybridised to 
the  slides.  The  slides  are  then  washed  and  ready  for  acquisition  of  images.  Images  will  be 
acquired using an appropriate software. 
 
 
Definition of MYC and MYCN amplification 
Based on published experience comparing copy number seen by FISH and log2ratios obtained 
by array-CGH [Bourdeaut et al (2013). MYC and MYCN amplification can be reliably assessed 
by aCGH in medulloblastoma. Cancer Genet. 206(4): 124-9], amplification is defined by a log2 
ratio ≥ 1.5 in at least three probes within the MYC or MYCN loci.  Any  focal  log2ratio  peak 
suspected  to  reveal  an  amplicon at  the MYC or MYCN locus,  but  with  a  <1.5  ratio,  must  be 
confirmed by FISH. Focal amplicons encompassing MYC or MYCN loci and not exceeding few 
magabases should be clearly distinguished from wider chromosome 2p or 8q gains. 
 
 
Definition of monosomy 6 
Monosomy 6 assessment by array-based copy number methods requires a tumour cell content 
at  least  equal  to  60%.  Monosomy  is  defined  by  a  log2ratio  ≤-0.5  across  the  whole  of 
chromosome 6, encompassing the p- and q-arms. 
 
In  order  to  appreciate  the  patterns  of  log2  ratios  obtained  for  monosomic  chromosomes  in 
comparative hybridisation analyses, it is recommended to hybridise tumour from male patients 
with  female  control  DNA.  As  an  internal  control,  the  minimal  log2ratio  for  a  complete 
monosomy  in  100%  of  the  cells is  given  by  the  X  chromosome  log2ratio  when  XY  tumour 
DNA is matched with XX control DNA. 
 
 
Data validation by a second national reference laboratory 
Results from array-based copy number analysis should be confirmed by exchange and review 
of data with a second national reference laboratory for the trial.

As    part    of    the    investigative    biological    studies    associated    with    newly    diagnosed 
medulloblastoma patients recruited to PNET 5 MB - LR and PNET 5 MB - SR clinical trials, 
the  SIOP  PNET  Biology  group  international  reference  laboratory  will  be  responsible  for  the 
construction of tissue microarray (TMA) composite blocks, and further processing of the FFPE 
material, to support biological studies within the trials.  
 
This  will  be  achieved  through  the  submission  of  FFPE  blocks  from  national  reference 
laboratories of the participating countries, to the international reference centre, once they have 
completed central pathology review and molecular diagnostic testing of the samples.  
 
Maintaining tissue integrity of the FFPE block for further diagnostic use by the local centre is 
of  paramount  importance.    Therefore,  TMA  will  only  be  undertaken  if  sample  size  is 
appropriate.  The  group  recognises  that  undertaking  TMA  preparation  at  a  international 
reference laboratory will optimise preparation of the FFPE resource for all contributing national 
laboratories and research groups.  
 
 
Procedure: 
 
1. National reference laboratories submit 1x FFPE block and corresponding haematoxylin 
and  eosin  (H&E) stained  slide  with  tumour  areas  marked  for  coring  (see  separate 
national reference centre SOP), to the international reference laboratory at Newcastle 
University, UK:

2. Using  the marked-up  H&E  for  reference,  up  to  5  x  1.0mm  tissue  cores  will  be  taken 
from the donor FFPE tissue blocks submitted and transferred to a recipient composite 
block. Tissue core positions will be robustly transcribed. The number of cores taken will 
depend upon the surface area and depth of the donor FFPE block.

3. If sufficient tissue remains in the block, the international reference laboratory will also 
cut the following to be available for subsequent investigative biological studies: 
a. 2 x 20 micron FFPE curls for DNA extraction 
b. 2 x 20 micron FFPE curls for preparation of nuclear extract slides 
c. 2 x 20 micron curls for RNA extraction (deepest curls) 
 
All curls will be stored at -80ºC.  
 
The  German  national  reference  centre  will  undertake  this  tissue  processing  for  German and 
Swiss cases, using the same procedures as the international reference centre.  
 
Material  will  subsequently  be  distributed  to  research  groups  for  approved  investigative 
biological studies conducted by the SIOP PNET Biology group.  
 
All FFPE blocks will be returned to national reference laboratories within 6 weeks of receipt. 
The marked up H&E sections will be retained at the international reference laboratory.

D.3. Sampling guidelines for blood 
 
Purpose 
Blood  of  each  patient  included  in  PNET  5  MB  should  be  stored  to  (i)  extract  constitutional 
DNA as control material for genomic analyses performed on the frozen tumour tissue and (ii) 
harvest the plasma for research of diagnostic markers. 
 
Sample acquisition and preparation 
A blood sample of 5-10 ml should be taken into  an EDTA or citrate tube during a  clinically 
needed blood sampling to avoid extra venopunctures: 
 
The blood  preparation  should  be  performed  ideally  within  2  hours  after  taking  of  the  blood 
sample. 
 
1. Label 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes with patient code and date. 
2. Centrifuge the 10 ml EDTA or citrate blood vial at 4 °C: 1100 x g 10 min. 
3. Take  supernatant  and  aliquot into  1  ml  aliquots,  transfer  aliquots  into  the  labeled 
Eppendorf tubes and store at -80°C. 
4. After having removed the supernatant fill up the tube to 10ml with a hypotonic buffer. 
5. Incubate a 4°C for 30 min. 
6. Centrifuge at 1500 rpm 5-10min. 
7. Decanter supernatant. 
8. Resuspend leukocytes with 1ml PBS. 
9. Transfer (ideally 2 aliquots) them to a 1.5ml Eppendorf tube. 
10. Spin down briefly and remove supernatant. 
11. Snap-freeze the pellet(s) and store them at -80°. 
 
If separation into leukocyte pellet and plasma is not possible, please store the whole blood 
sample at -80°C. 
 
Retain tubes initially at the local treatment centre.  Samples should periodically be shipped to 
the national reference centre, who will coordinate the shipment.

D.4. Sampling guidelines for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for research use 
 
Purpose 
CSF of each patient included in PNET 5 MB - LR and PNET 5 MB - SR trials should be stored 
for research use. 
 
Sample acquisition and preparation 
Lumbar puncture showing a CSF free of tumour cells is mandatory before randomisation. It is 
allowed (and recommended for keeping time lines for stratification and to start radiotherapy, if 
the  clinical  situation  allows  lumbar  puncture)  to  perform  lumbar  puncture  within  the  first  2 
weeks  after  surgery.  If  a  lumbar  puncture  is  performed  before  15  days  after  surgery  and  is 
negative  for  tumour  cells,  then  this  will  be  taken  as  evidence  of  non-metastatic  disease.  If, 
however,  the  CSF  is  positive  for tumour cells  on  lumbar  puncture  taken  before  day  15,  the 
lumbar puncture must be repeated at day 15 or later.  
In  case  of  equivocal  CSF  cytology,  performance  of  a  second  lumbar  puncture  is  also 
recommended. (see chapter 8.1. Screening investigations, page 58) 
In  addition  to  the  CSF  material  routinely  collected  for  clinical  assessment,  additional  CSF 
should be harvested when possible, and the sample divided for preparation as follows. 
 
Preparation of CSF (if procedures are possible at local treatment centre): 
Label 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes with patient code, date and 'CSF supernatant' 
Centrifuge CSF 
After centrifugation save the supernatant 
Aliquot supernatant into 0.5ml aliquots and transfer into labeled tubes 
Store tubes at -80°C. 
 
For  preparation  of  any  additional  CSF  collected  (or  if  collection  of CSF supernatant 
(above) is not possible): 
Label 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes with patient code, date and 'whole CSF' 
Aliquot CSF into 0.5ml aliquots and transfer into labeled tubes 
Store tubes at -80°C. 
 
Storage and shipment: 
Retain tubes at local treatment centre. 
Samples should periodically be shipped to the national reference centre, who will coordinate 
the shipment.

D.5. DNA and RNA extraction at national reference centres 
 
Purpose 
High  molecular  weight  DNA  and  RNA  will  be  extracted  from  frozen  tumour  biopsies  at 
national reference centres.  DNA will be used to conduct -catenin (CTNNB1) mutation testing.  
Excess  DNA  and  RNA  will  be  made  available to  research  centres  to  conduct  approved 
biological studies, according to national regulation and consent of the patient.  
 
Sample preparation 
1. Frozen tumour biopsies provided by local treatment centres should be stored at -80
o
C at all 
times. 
 
2. Frozen tumour biopsies with confirmed high tumour cell content (determined by H&E stain 
of a frozen section - see national reference centre sample preparation SOP) should be chipped 
into small aliquots under liquid nitrogen, and stored in cryovials. 
 
3.    High  molecular  weight  DNA  and  RNA  should  be  extracted  from  chipped  tissue  aliquots 
using the ‘AllPrep DNA/RNA extraction mini kit’ (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's 
instructions.   
 
4. Extracted high molecular weight DNA should be resuspended at a concentration >75ng/μl, 
in water or  an appropriate buffer (e.g. TE), in 1.5ml eppendorf tubes.  Concentration (ng/μl) 
and total yield (ng) should be assessed spectrophotometrically (absorbance at 260nm), and its 
260/280nm ratio determined.  These values should be recorded. 
 
5.    Extracted  RNA  should  be  resuspended  in  water  at  a  concentration  >75ng/μl,  in  1.5ml 
eppendorf   tubes.      Concentration   (ng/μl)   and   total   yield   (ng)   should   be   assessed 
spectrophotometrically  (absorbance  at  260nm),  and  its  260/280nm  ratio  determined.    These 
values should be recorded.   
 
6.  RNA quality should be assessed using a bioanalyser (Agilent), and the RIN value recorded. 
  
7.    Extracted    nucleic  acids  should  be  stored  at -80
o
C  and  retained  at  the  national  reference 
centre.   
 
Aliquots of extracts should periodically be shipped on request to research centres, to undertake 
approved trials biological studies. Extract movements will be coordinated by the SIOP PNET 
Biology group.

Appendix E 
 
1 
E- Patient / Parent Information Forms and Informed Consent 
 
 
Accepted national procedures for patient consent are to be used. Therefore these forms have 
to be designed seperately by each participating national group. 
 
 
The patient’s and/or parent’s written consent to participate in the study must be obtained after 
a  full  explanation  has  been  given  of  the  treatment  options  including  the  conventional  and 
generally accepted methods of treatment and the manner of treatment allocation. For children 
and adolescents who are too young to give informed consent, depending on national definitions, 
informed consent will be obtained in written form from the parents. Patient assent may also be 
obtained,  depending  on  national  requirements.Additionally  the  child  should  receive  an 
explanation as to his/her means of understanding and should give consent as well, if he/she is 
able to do so. Enough time and the opportunity to discuss participation before the decision for 
and start of treatment have to be given. The right of a patient to refuse to participate without 
giving reasons must be respected. 
 
It is recommended to obtain a separate consent for the submission of tumour material, MRI, 
and patient data at the time when the pathological diagnosis of medulloblastoma has been made 
locally, as these need to be sent to the respective reference centres before eligibility for PNET 
5 MB - LR and PNET 5 MB - SR can be checked.  
 
Written informed consent should also be obtained for the biological studies, in accordance with 
national guidelines. These should include consent for the link-anonymised investigation of all 
biological materials collected (i.e. tumour biopsy, CSF, blood), including germline DNA.

E.1. - Information on Follow-Up Evaluations - Template 
Information for adults and young adults about necessary follow-up evaluations  
 
 
Dear Patient, 
 
you have been treated for a medulloblastoma within the PNET 5 MB study. 
Although treatment has been completed, regular follow-up examinations through a specalized, 
multidisciplinary team is highly recommended. 
 
Follow-up  examinations  are  necessary  to  detect  a  possible  relapse  of  the  medulloblastoma, 
tumour and therapy-related late-effects, and a possible secondary neoplasm. 
 
Relapses: 
An intensive treatment as in PNET 5 MB is effective in long term disease contol in the majority 
of  patients,  who  have  been  diagnosed  with  a  localised  medulloblastoma  of  moderate  or  low 
biological risk  group.  However,  some  patients  experience  relapses  after  the  end  of  therapy. 
While the risk of relapse is highest in the first 2 years after the end of treatment, in some cases 
relapses also occur several years after treatment.  
Regular  clinical  and  neurological  examinations,  and  MRI  evaluations  of  the  brain  will  be 
performed for detection of relapse. 
 
Late-effects: 
Treatment can lead to side effects, which sometimes manifest after a prolonged interval after 
treatment.  On  the  one  hand  the  diagnosis  of the  late  effects  is  necessary  to  arrange  for  the 
appropriate support, on the other hand evaluation and documentation of treatment related side 
effects is necessary for the asessment of the study treatment.  
Examples for treatment related side effects, which can be detected even some time after the end 
of treatment may be: 
 
- Hearing deficits:  
 Some  patients  experience  clinically  relevant  hearing  impairment  after  treatment  for  a 
medulloblastoma.  Monitoring  of  hearing  deficits  has  been  performed  while  and  after  the 
therapy.  However,  even  in  the  absence  of  a  clinically  relevant  hearing  deficit  at  the  end  of 
therapy, in very rare cases, this might be apparent at a later time point. Patients with documented 
hearing deficit at the end of therapy might experience worsening of hearing function over time. 
In case of apparent, clinical relevant hearing deficit, respective hearing aids can be prescribed. 
 
- Deficits in hormone regulation: 
 Deficits   in   hormone   regulations   are   commonly   observed   after   treatment   for 
medulloblastoma. These can be monitored using blood tests. Due to the age specific complex 
regulation  of  hormone  excretion,  deficits  can  also  manifest  sooner  or  later  after  the  end  of 
therapy, depending on the age of the patient. Hormonal dysfunctions can lead to:  
 - Problems with growth  
 - Problems with pubertal development 
 - Problems concerning fertiliy 
 - Thyroid problems 
Therapy would include individual adapted hormone substitution.

Appendix E 
 
3 
- Renal function: 
 Very  rarely,  impairment  of  renal  function  can  be experienced  after  treatment  of 
medulloblastoma. Monitoring of deficits in renal function has been performed on treatment and 
may be required after completion of chemotherapy. 
 
- Neurocognitive / neurologic impairments: 
 Some  patients  experience  impairments in  specific  physical  or  mental  abilities.  This 
might  lead  to  specific  questions  and  problems  in  selecting  appropriate  educational  or 
occupational options. In these cases, an experienced psychosocial team should be able to give 
necessary support. 
 
Secondary neoplasm: 
Rarely, another tumour within the brain, within the thyroid gland, or at another site can occur 
years  after  the  end  of  the  treatment.  Surveillance  within  follow-up  cannot  encompass  all 
possible manifestations, but a regular thyroid screening (yearly TSH level) is indicated.  
 
The following evaluations should be performed for post treatment follow-up 
* i.e. 2 and 5 years after diagnosis 
 
Documentation  of  late-effects  for  the  PNET  5  MB  study  is  necessary  2  and  5  years  after 
treatment, and at age 18. 
 
If due to your age you cannot be followed by your paediatric oncologic team anymore, please 
make shure, that the necessary documentation of late effects will be performed by the respective 
medical  team  in  charge – or  data  will  be  transferred  for  documentation  to  the paediatric 
oncologic team. 
 
 
If  you  are  seeking  medical  help  outside  the  specialized  follow-up care,  please  inform  your 
physician on the diagnosis and treatment of medulloblastoma.

Ethical Considerations 
 
The trial protocol must be approved by the appropriate ethical committee in each country prior 
to patient entry. The patient's and/or parent's written consent to participate in the study must be 
obtained after a full explanation has been given concerning the treatment.  As well as consent 
for the clinical trial, consent is required for participation in the biological studies and, depending 
on  national  law,  consent  is  needed  for  data  collection,  storage,  transfer  and  analysis.  
Additionally the child should receive an explanation as to his/her means of understanding and 
should give consent as well if he or she is able to do it. 
 
The  right  of  a  patient  to  refuse  to  participate  without  giving  reasons  must  be  respected.  The 
patient  must  remain  free  to  withdraw  at  any  time  from  protocol  without  prejudicing  his/her 
further treatment. The study observes the rules for clinical research set out in the ICH/GCP and 
EC rules of good clinical practice.

World  Medical  Association  Declaration  of  Helsinki:  Ethical  Principles  for  Medical 
Research Involving Human Subjects 
 
Adopted by the 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by 
the:  
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 1975 
35th WMA General Assembly, Venice, Italy, October 1983

59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, Republic of Korea, October 2008 
64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013 
 
PREAMBLE 
1.  The  World  Medical  Association  (WMA)  has  developed  the  Declaration  of  Helsinki  as  a 
statement  of  ethical  principles  for  medical  research  involving  human  subjects,  including 
research on identifiable human material and data. 
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should 
be applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs. 
2.  Consistent  with  the  mandate  of  the  WMA,  the Declaration  is  addressed  primarily  to 
physicians.  The  WMA  encourages  others  who  are  involved  in  medical  research  involving 
human subjects to adopt these principles. 
GENERAL PRINCIPLES 
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health of 
my  patient  will  be  my  first  consideration,”  and  the  International  Code  of  Medical  Ethics 
declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when providing medical care.” 
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well-being and rights of 
patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and 
conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty. 
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human 
subjects. 
6.  The  primary  purpose  of  medical  research  involving  human  subjects  is  to  understand  the 
causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic 
interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best proven interventions must 
be   evaluated   continually   through   research   for   their   safety,   effectiveness,   efficiency, 
accessibility and quality. 
7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all human 
subjects and protect their health and rights. 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17  Ethical Considerations and Declaration of Helsinki 
Appendix G 
 3 
8. While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal can 
never take precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects. 
9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research to protect the life, health, 
dignity,   integrity,   right   to   self-determination,   privacy,   and   confidentiality   of   personal 
information of research subjects. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must 
always rest with the physician or other health care professionals and never with the research 
subjects, even though they have given consent. 
10. Physicians must consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for research 
involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international norms and 
standards. No national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or 
eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration. 
11.  Medical  research  should  be  conducted  in  a  manner  that  minimises  possible  harm  to  the 
environment. 
12. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by individuals with the 
appropriate ethics and scientific education, training and qualifications. Research on patients or 
healthy  volunteers  requires  the  supervision  of  a  competent  and  appropriately  qualified 
physician or other health care professional. 
13. Groups that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate access 
to participation in research. 
14. Physicians who combine medical research with medical care should involve their patients 
in  research  only  to  the  extent  that  this  is  justified  by  its  potential  preventive,  diagnostic  or 
therapeutic  value  and  if  the  physician  has  good  reason  to  believe  that  participation  in  the 
research study will not adversely affect the health of the patients who serve as research subjects. 
15.  Appropriate  compensation  and  treatment  for  subjects  who  are harmed  as  a  result  of 
participating in research must be ensured. 
RISKS, BURDENS AND BENEFITS 
16. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and burdens. 
Medical  research  involving  human  subjects  may  only  be  conducted  if  the  importance  of  the 
objective outweighs the risks and burdens to the research subjects. 
17. All medical research involving human subjects must be preceded by careful assessment of 
predictable  risks  and  burdens  to  the  individuals  and  groups  involved  in  the research  in 
comparison with foreseeable benefits to them and to other individuals or groups affected by the 
condition under investigation. 
Measures  to  minimise  the  risks  must  be  implemented.  The  risks  must  be  continuously 
monitored, assessed and documented by the researcher. 
18. Physicians may not be involved in a research study involving human subjects unless they 
are confident that the risks have been adequately assessed and can be satisfactorily managed. 
When the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or when there is conclusive proof 
of definitive outcomes, physicians must assess whether to continue, modify or immediately stop 
the study. 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17  Ethical Considerations and Declaration of Helsinki 
Appendix G

VULNERABLE GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS 
19.  Some  groups  and  individuals  are  particularly  vulnerable  and  may  have  an  increased 
likelihood of being wronged or of incurring additional harm. 
All vulnerable groups and individuals should receive specifically considered protection. 
20. Medical research with a vulnerable group is only justified if the research is responsive to 
the  health  needs  or  priorities  of  this  group  and  the  research  cannot  be  carried  out  in  a  non-
vulnerable group. In addition, this group should stand to benefit from the knowledge, practices 
or interventions that result from the research. 
SCIENTIFIC REQUIREMENTS AND RESEARCH PROTOCOLS 
21. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific 
principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources 
of  information,  and  adequate  laboratory  and,  as  appropriate,  animal  experimentation.  The 
welfare of animals used for research must be respected. 
22.  The  design  and  performance  of  each  research  study  involving  human  subjects  must  be 
clearly described and justified in a research protocol. 
The  protocol  should  contain  a  statement  of  the  ethical  considerations  involved  and  should 
indicate  how  the  principles  in  this  Declaration  have  been  addressed.  The  protocol  should 
include information regarding funding, sponsors, institutional affiliations, potential conflicts of 
interest,  incentives  for  subjects  and  information  regarding  provisions  for  treating  and/or 
compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the research study. 
In  clinical  trials,  the  protocol  must  also  describe  appropriate  arrangements  for  post-trial 
provisions. 
RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEES 
23.  The  research  protocol  must  be  submitted  for  consideration,  comment,  guidance  and 
approval to the concerned research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee 
must be transparent in its functioning, must be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and 
any other undue influence and must be duly qualified. It must take into consideration the laws 
and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as 
applicable  international  norms  and  standards  but  these  must  not  be  allowed  to  reduce  or 
eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration. 
The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide 
monitoring  information  to  the  committee,  especially  information  about  any  serious  adverse 
events. No amendment to the protocol may be made without consideration and approval by the 
committee.  After  the  end  of  the  study,  the  researchers  must  submit  a  final  report  to  the 
committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions. 
PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY 
24.  Every  precaution  must  be  taken  to  protect  the  privacy  of  research  subjects  and  the 
confidentiality of their personal information 
INFORMED CONSENT 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17  Ethical Considerations and Declaration of Helsinki 
Appendix G

25.  Participation  by  individuals  capable  of  giving  informed  consent  as  subjects  in  medical 
research  must  be  voluntary.  Although  it  may  be  appropriate  to  consult  family  members  or 
community  leaders,  no  individual  capable  of  giving  informed  consent  may  be  enrolled  in  a 
research study unless he or she freely agrees. 
26.  In  medical  research  involving  human  subjects  capable  of  giving  informed  consent,  each 
potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any 
possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits 
and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail, post-study provisions and any 
other relevant aspects of the study. The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse 
to  participate  in  the  study  or  to  withdraw  consent  to  participate  at  any  time  without  reprisal. 
Special  attention  should  be  given  to  the  specific  information  needs  of  individual  potential 
subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the information. 
After  ensuring  that  the  potential  subject  has  understood  the  information,  the  physician  or 
another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject’s freely-given 
informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non-
written consent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
All medical research subjects should be given the option of being informed about the general 
outcome and results of the study. 
27. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician must be 
particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or 
may  consent  under  duress.  In such  situations  the  informed  consent  must  be  sought  by  an 
appropriately qualified individual who is completely independent of this relationship. 
28. For a potential research subject who is incapable of giving informed consent, the physician 
must seek informed consent from the legally authorised representative. These individuals must 
not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended 
to  promote  the  health  of  the  group  represented  by  the  potential  subject,  the  research  cannot 
instead  be  performed  with  persons  capable  of  providing  informed  consent,  and  the  research 
entails only minimal risk and minimal burden. 
29. When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable of giving informed consent is 
able  to  give  assent  to  decisions  about  participation  in  research,  the  physician  must  seek  that 
assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorised representative. The potential subject’s 
dissent should be respected. 
30.  Research  involving  subjects  who  are  physically  or  mentally  incapable  of  giving  consent, 
for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that 
prevents  giving informed consent is a necessary  characteristic of the research  group.  In such 
circumstances   the   physician   must   seek   informed   consent   from   the   legally   authorised 
representative. If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the 
study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving 
subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated 
in  the  research  protocol  and  the  study  has  been  approved  by  a  research  ethics  committee. 
Consent to remain in the research must be obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a 
legally authorised representative. 

SIOP PNET 5 MB Final Version 11 - 2014, Nov 17  Ethical Considerations and Declaration of Helsinki 
Appendix G

31. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to the 
research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw 
from the study must never adversely affect the patient-physician relationship. 
32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on material 
or data contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed consent 
for  its  collection,  storage  and/or  reuse.  There  may  be  exceptional  situations  where  consent 
would be impossible or impracticable to obtain for such research. In such situations the research 
may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee. 
USE OF PLACEBO 
33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against 
those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances: 
Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; or 
Where  for  compelling  and  scientifically  sound  methodological  reasons  the  use  of  any 
intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is 
necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention 
and the patients who receive any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, 
or  no  intervention  will  not  be  subject  to  additional  risks  of  serious  or  irreversible  harm  as  a 
result of not receiving the best proven intervention. 
Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. 
POST-TRIAL PROVISIONS 
34.  In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country  governments should 
make provisions for post-trial access for all participants who still need an intervention identified 
as  beneficial  in  the  trial.  This  information  must  also  be  disclosed  to  participants  during  the 
informed consent process. 
RESEARCH   REGISTRATION   AND   PUBLICATION   AND   DISSEMINATION   OF 
RESULTS
